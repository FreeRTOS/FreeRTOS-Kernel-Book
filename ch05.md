# 5 Queue Management

## 5.1 Introduction

'Queues' provide a task-to-task, task-to-interrupt, and
interrupt-to-task communication mechanism.


### 5.1.1 Scope

This chapter covers:

- How to create a queue.
- How a queue manages the data it contains.
- How to send data to a queue.
- How to receive data from a queue.
- What it means to block on a queue.
- How to block on multiple queues.
- How to overwrite data in a queue.
- How to clear a queue.
- The effect of task priorities when writing to and reading from a queue.

This chapter only covers task-to-task communication. Chapter 7 covers
task-to-interrupt and interrupt-to-task communication.


## 5.2 Characteristics of a Queue

### 5.2.1 Data Storage

A queue can hold a finite number of fixed size data items[^8]. The
maximum number of items a queue can hold is called its 'length'. Both
the length and the size of each data item are set when the queue is
created.

[^8]: FreeRTOS message buffers, described in chapter TBD, provide a
lighter weight alternative to queues that hold variable length
messages.

Queues are normally used as First In First Out (FIFO) buffers, where
data is written to the end (tail) of the queue and removed from the
front (head) of the queue. Figure 5.1 demonstrates data being written to
and read from a queue that is being used as a FIFO. It is also possible
to write to the front of a queue, and to overwrite data that is already
at the front of a queue.

<a name="fig5.1" title="Figure 5.1 An example sequence of writes to, and reads from a queue"></a>

***Figure 5.1*** *An example sequence of writes to, and reads from a queue*
* * *

There are two ways in which queue behaviour can be implemented:

1. Queue by copy

    Queuing by copy means the data sent to the queue is copied byte for
    byte into the queue.

1. Queue by reference

    Queuing by reference means the queue only holds pointers to the data
    sent to the queue, not the data itself.

FreeRTOS uses the queue by copy method because it is both more
powerful and simpler to use than queueing by reference because:

- Queuing by copy does not prevent the queue from also being used to
  queue by reference. For example, when the size of the data being
  queued makes it impractical to copy the data into the queue, then a
  pointer to the data can be copied into the queue instead.

- A stack variable can be sent directly to a queue, even though the
  variable will not exist after the function in which it is declared
  has exited.

- Data can be sent to a queue without first allocating a buffer to
  hold the data—you then copy the data into the allocated buffer
  and queue a reference to the buffer.

- The sending task can immediately re-use the variable or buffer that
  was sent to the queue.

- The sending task and the receiving task are completely
  de-coupled; an application designer does not need to concern
  themself with which task 'owns' the data, or which task is
  responsible for releasing the data.

- The RTOS takes complete responsibility for allocating the memory
  used to store data.

- Memory protected systems restrict access to RAM, in which case
  queueing by reference can only be accomplished if the sending and
  receiving tasks can both access the referenced data. Queuing by copy
  allows data to pass across memory protection boundaries.


### 5.2.2 Access by Multiple Tasks

Queues are objects in their own right and can be accessed by any task
or ISR that knows of their existence. Any number of tasks can write to
the same queue, and any number of tasks can read from the same queue. In
practice, it is very common for a queue to have multiple writers, but
much less common for a queue to have multiple readers.


### 5.2.3 Blocking on Queue Reads

When a task attempts to read from a queue, it can optionally specify a
'block' time. This is the time the task is kept in the Blocked state to
wait for data to become available from the queue, if the queue
is already empty. A task that is in the Blocked state waiting for data
to become available from a queue is automatically moved to the Ready
state when another task or interrupt places data into the queue. The
task will also be moved automatically from the Blocked state to the
Ready state if the specified block time expires before data becomes
available.

Queues can have multiple readers, so it is possible for a single queue
to have more than one task blocked on it waiting for data. When this is
the case, only one task is unblocked when data becomes available. The
task that is unblocked is always the highest priority task that is
waiting for data. If two or more blocked tasks have equal priority, then the
task that is unblocked is the one that has been waiting the longest.


### 5.2.4 Blocking on Queue Writes

Just as it can when reading from a queue, a task can optionally specify a block
time when writing to a queue. In this case, the block time is the
maximum time the task will be held in the Blocked state to wait for
space to become available on the queue, should the queue already be
full.

Queues can have multiple writers, so it is possible for a full queue to
have more than one task blocked on it waiting to complete a send
operation. When this is the case, only one task is unblocked when space
on the queue becomes available. The task that is unblocked is always the
highest priority task that is waiting for space. If two or more blocked tasks
have equal priority, then the task that is unblocked is the one that has been
waiting the longest.


### 5.2.5 Blocking on Multiple Queues

Queues can be grouped into sets, allowing a task to enter the Blocked
state to wait for data to become available on any of the queues in the
set. Section 5.6, Receiving From Multiple Queues, demonstrates queue
sets.


### 5.2.6 Creating Queues: Statically Allocated and Dynamically Allocated Queues

Queues are referenced by handles, which are variables of type
`QueueHandle_t`. A queue must be explicitly created before it can be used.

Two API functions create queues: `xQueueCreate()`, `xQueueCreateStatic()`.

Each queue requires two blocks of RAM, the first to hold its data
structure, and the second to hold queued data. `xQueueCreate()` allocates
the required RAM from the heap (dynamically). `xQueueCreateStatic()` uses
pre-allocated RAM passed into the function as parameters.


## 5.3 Using a Queue

### 5.3.1 The xQueueCreate() API Function

Listing 5.1 shows the `xQueueCreate()` function prototype.
`xQueueCreateStatic()` has two additional parameters that point to the
memory pre-allocated to hold the queue's data structure and data storage
area, respectively.

<a name="list5.1" title="Listing 5.1 The xQueueCreate() API function prototype"></a>

```c
QueueHandle_t xQueueCreate( UBaseType_t uxQueueLength, UBaseType_t uxItemSize );
```
***Listing 5.1*** *The xQueueCreate() API function prototype*


**xQueueCreate() parameters and return value:**

- `uxQueueLength`

  The maximum number of items that the queue being created can hold at
  any one time.

- `uxItemSize`

  The size in bytes of each data item that can be stored in the queue.

- Return value

  If NULL is returned, then the queue cannot be created because
  there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to allocate the
  queue data structures and storage area. Chapter 2 provides more
  information on the FreeRTOS heap.

  If a non-NULL value is returned then the queue was created
  successfully and the returned value is the handle to the created
  queue.

`xQueueReset()` is an API function that restores a previously created queue
to its original empty state.


### 5.3.2 The xQueueSendToBack() and xQueueSendToFront() API Functions

As might be expected, `xQueueSendToBack()` sends data to the back (tail)
of a queue, and `xQueueSendToFront()` sends data to the front (head) of a
queue.

`xQueueSend()` is equivalent to, and exactly the same as,
`xQueueSendToBack()`.

> *Note: Never call `xQueueSendToFront()` or `xQueueSendToBack()` from an
> interrupt service routine. The interrupt-safe versions
>`xQueueSendToFrontFromISR()` and `xQueueSendToBackFromISR()` should be used
> in their place. These are described in Chapter 7.*

<a name="list5.2" title="Listing 5.2 The xQueueSendToFront() API function prototype"></a>


```c
BaseType_t xQueueSendToFront( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                              const void * pvItemToQueue,
                              TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 5.2*** *The xQueueSendToFront() API function prototype*


<a name="list5.3" title="Listing 5.3 The xQueueSendToBack() API function prototype"></a>


```c
BaseType_t xQueueSendToBack( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                             const void * pvItemToQueue,
                             TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 5.3*** *The xQueueSendToBack() API function prototype*


**xQueueSendToFront() and xQueueSendToBack() function parameters and return value**

- `xQueue`

  The handle of the queue to which the data is being sent (written).
  The queue handle will have been returned from the call to `xQueueCreate()`
  or `xQueueCreateStatic()` which are used to create the queue.

- `pvItemToQueue`

  A pointer to the data to be copied into the queue.

  The size of each item the queue can hold is set when the queue is
  created, so that many bytes are copied from `pvItemToQueue` into the queue
  storage area.

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked
  state to wait for space to become available on the queue, should the
  queue already be full.
  
  Both `xQueueSendToFront()` and `xQueueSendToBack()` will return
  immediately if `xTicksToWait` is zero and the queue is already full.
  
  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.
  
  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without timing out), provided `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set
  to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Return value

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS`

    `pdPASS` is returned when data was successfully sent to the queue.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then it is
    possible the calling task was placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    space to become available in the queue before the function returned,
    but data was successfully written to the queue before the block time
    expired.

  - `errQUEUE_FULL` (same value as `pdFAIL`)

    `errQUEUE_FULL` is returned if data could not be written to the queue
    because the queue was already full.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero) then the
    calling task will have been placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    another task or interrupt to make space in the queue, but the specified
    block time expired before that happened.


### 5.3.3 The xQueueReceive() API Function

`xQueueReceive()` receives (reads) an item from a queue. The received item
is removed from the queue.

> *Note: Never call `xQueueReceive()` from an interrupt service routine. The
> interrupt-safe `xQueueReceiveFromISR()` API function is described in
> Chapter 7.*

<a name="list5.4" title="Listing 5.4 The xQueueReceive() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueueReceive( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                          void * const pvBuffer,
                          TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 5.4*** *The xQueueReceive() API function prototype*


**xQueueReceive() function parameters and return values**

- `xQueue`

  The handle of the queue from which the data is being received
  (read). The queue handle will have been returned from the call to
  `xQueueCreate()` or `xQueueCreateStatic()` used to create the queue.

- `pvBuffer`

  A pointer to the memory into which the received data will be copied.

  The size of each data item that the queue holds is set when the queue
  is created. The memory pointed to by `pvBuffer` must be at least large
  enough to hold that many bytes.

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the task should remain in the Blocked
  state to wait for data to become available on the queue, if the
  queue is already be empty.

  If `xTicksToWait` is zero, then `xQueueReceive()` will return immediately
  if the queue is already empty.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.

  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without timing out) provided `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set
  to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Return value

  There are two possible return values:
  
  - `pdPASS`

    `pdPASS` is returned when data was successfully read from the queue.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then it is
    possible the calling task was placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    data to become available on the queue, but data was successfully read
    from the queue before the block time expired.</p>

  - `errQUEUE_EMPTY` (same value as `pdFAIL`)

    `errQUEUE_EMPTY` is returned if data cannot be read from the queue
    because the queue is already empty.

    If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero,) then the
    calling task will have been placed into the Blocked state to wait for
    another task or interrupt to send data to the queue, but the block time
    expired before that happened.


### 5.3.4 The uxQueueMessagesWaiting() API Function

`uxQueueMessagesWaiting()` queries the number of items currently in a queue.

> *Note: Never call `uxQueueMessagesWaiting()` from an interrupt service
> routine. The interrupt-safe `uxQueueMessagesWaitingFromISR()` should be
> used in its place.*

<a name="list5.5" title="Listing 5.5 The uxQueueMessagesWaiting() API function prototype"></a>

```c
UBaseType_t uxQueueMessagesWaiting( QueueHandle_t xQueue );
```
***Listing 5.5*** *The uxQueueMessagesWaiting() API function prototype*


**uxQueueMessagesWaiting() function parameters and return value**

- `xQueue`

  The handle of the queue being queried. The queue handle will have
  been returned from the call to `xQueueCreate()` or `xQueueCreateStatic()`
  which are used to create the queue.

- Return value

  The number of items currently in the queue being queried. If zero is returned, 
  then the queue is empty.


<a name="example5.1" title="Example 5.1 Blocking when receiving from a queue"></a>
---
***Example 5.1*** *Blocking when receiving from a queue*

---

This example demonstrates creating a queue, sending data to the queue
from multiple tasks, and receiving data from the queue. The queue is
created to hold data items of type `int32_t`. The tasks that send to the
queue do not specify a block time, whereas the task that receives from
the queue does.

The tasks that send to the queue have a lower priority than the task
that receives from the queue. This means the queue should never contain
more than one item because, as soon as data is sent to the queue the
receiving task will unblock, pre-empt the sending task (because it has a
higher priority), and remove the data, leaving the queue empty once
again.

The example creates two instances of the task shown in Listing 5.6, one
that continuously writes the value 100 to the queue, and another that
continuously writes the value 200 to the same queue. The task parameter
is used to pass these values into each task instance.

<a name="list5.6" title="Listing 5.6 Implementation of the sending task used in Example 5.1"></a>

```c
static void vSenderTask( void *pvParameters )
{

    int32_t lValueToSend;

    BaseType_t xStatus;

    /* Two instances of this task are created so the value that is sent to
       the queue is passed in via the task parameter - this way each instance 
       can use a different value. The queue was created to hold values of type 
       int32_t, so cast the parameter to the required type. */
    lValueToSend = ( int32_t ) pvParameters;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {

        /* Send the value to the queue.

           The first parameter is the queue to which data is being sent. The
           queue was created before the scheduler was started, so before this 
           task started to execute.

           The second parameter is the address of the data to be sent, in this 
           case the address of lValueToSend.

           The third parameter is the Block time – the time the task should be 
           kept in the Blocked state to wait for space to become available on 
           the queue should the queue already be full. In this case a block 
           time is not specified because the queue should never contain more 
           than one item, and therefore never be full. */
        xStatus = xQueueSendToBack( xQueue, &lValueToSend, 0 );

        if( xStatus != pdPASS )
        {
            /* The send operation could not complete because the queue was full-
               this must be an error as the queue should never contain more than
               one item! */
            vPrintString( "Could not send to the queue.\r\n" );
        }
    }
}
```
***Listing 5.6*** *Implementation of the sending task used in Example 5.1*


Listing 5.7 shows the implementation of the task that receives data from
the queue. The receiving task specifies a block time of 100
milliseconds, then enters the Blocked state to wait for data to become
available. It leaves the Blocked state when either data is available on
the queue, or 100 milliseconds passes without data becoming available.
In this example, there are two tasks continuously writing to the queue
so the 100 milliseconds timeout never expires.

<a name="list5.7" title="Listing 5.7  Implementation of the receiver task for Example 5.1"></a>

```c
static void vReceiverTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    /* Declare the variable that will hold the values received from the
       queue. */
    int32_t lReceivedValue;
    BaseType_t xStatus;
    const TickType_t xTicksToWait = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 100 );

    /* This task is also defined within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* This call should always find the queue empty because this task will
           immediately remove any data that is written to the queue. */
        if( uxQueueMessagesWaiting( xQueue ) != 0 )
        {
            vPrintString( "Queue should have been empty!\r\n" );
        }

        /* Receive data from the queue.

           The first parameter is the queue from which data is to be received.
           The queue is created before the scheduler is started, and therefore
           before this task runs for the first time.

           The second parameter is the buffer into which the received data will
           be placed. In this case the buffer is simply the address of a 
           variable that has the required size to hold the received data.

           The last parameter is the block time – the maximum amount of time 
           that the task will remain in the Blocked state to wait for data to 
           be available should the queue already be empty. */
        xStatus = xQueueReceive( xQueue, &lReceivedValue, xTicksToWait );

        if( xStatus == pdPASS )
        {
            /* Data was successfully received from the queue, print out the
               received value. */
            vPrintStringAndNumber( "Received = ", lReceivedValue );
        }
        else
        {
            /* Data was not received from the queue even after waiting for 
               100ms. This must be an error as the sending tasks are free 
               running and will be continuously writing to the queue. */
            vPrintString( "Could not receive from the queue.\r\n" );
        }
    }
}
```
***Listing 5.7***  *Implementation of the receiver task for Example 5.1*


Listing 5.8 contains the definition of the `main()` function. This simply
creates the queue and the three tasks before starting the scheduler. The
queue is created to hold a maximum of five `int32_t` values, even though
the relative task priorities mean the queue will never hold more than
one item at a time.

<a name="list5.8" title="Listing 5.8 The implementation of main() in Example 5.1"></a>

```c
/* Declare a variable of type QueueHandle_t. This is used to store the
   handle to the queue that is accessed by all three tasks. */
QueueHandle_t xQueue;

int main( void )
{

       large enough to hold a variable of type int32_t. */
    xQueue = xQueueCreate( 5, sizeof( int32_t ) );

    if( xQueue != NULL )
    {

           while the other task will continuously write 200 to the queue. Both
           tasks are created at priority 1. */
        xTaskCreate( vSenderTask, "Sender1", 1000, ( void * ) 100, 1, NULL );
        xTaskCreate( vSenderTask, "Sender2", 1000, ( void * ) 200, 1, NULL );

        /* Create the task that will read from the queue. The task is created
           with priority 2, so above the priority of the sender tasks. */
        xTaskCreate( vReceiverTask, "Receiver", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL );

        /* Start the scheduler so the created tasks start executing. */

## 5.4 Receiving Data From Multiple Sources

It is common in FreeRTOS designs for a task to receive data from more
than one source. The receiving task needs to know where the data came
from to determine what to do with it. An easy design pattern to achieve
that uses a single queue to transfer structures that contain both the
data value and data source, as demonstrated in Figure 5.4.

<a name="fig5.4" title="Figure 5.4 An example scenario where structures are sent on a queue"></a>

* * *
![](media/image34.png)   
***Figure 5.4*** *An example scenario where structures are sent on a queue*
* * *

Referring to Figure 5.4:

- The created queue holds structures of type `Data_t`. The structure
  allows both a data value and an enumerated type indicating what the
  data means to be sent to the queue in one message.

- A central Controller task performs the primary system function. This
  has to react to inputs and changes to the system state communicated
  to it on the queue.

- A CAN bus task is used to encapsulate the CAN bus interfacing
  functionality. When the CAN bus task has received and decoded a
  message, it sends the already decoded message to the Controller task
  in a `Data_t` structure. The `eDataID` member of the transferred
  structure tells the Controller task what the data is. In the case 
  shown here, it is a motor speed value. The `lDataValue` member of the
  transferred structure tells the Controller task the actual motor
  speed value.

- A Human Machine Interface (HMI) task is used to encapsulate all the
  HMI functionality. The machine operator can probably input commands
  and query values in a number of ways that have to be detected and
  interpreted within the HMI task. When a new command is input, the
  HMI task sends the command to the Controller task in a `Data_t`
  structure. The `eDataID` member of the transferred structure tells the
  Controller task what the data is. In the case shown here, it is a new
  set point value. The `lDataValue` member of the transferred structure
  tells the Controller task the actual set point value.

Chapter (RB-TBD) shows how to extend this design pattern such that
the controller task can reply directly to the task that queued a structure.


<a name="example5.2" title="Example 5.2 Blocking when sending to a queue, and sending structures on a queue"></a>
---
***Example 5.2*** *Blocking when sending to a queue, and sending structures on a queue*

---

Example 5.2 is similar to Example 5.1, but with reversed task priorities,
so the receiving task has a lower priority than the sending tasks. Also,
the created queue holds structures rather than integers.

Listing 5.9 shows the definition of the structure used by Example 5.2.

<a name="list5.9" title="Listing 5.9 The definition of the structure that is to be passed on a queue, plus the declaration of two variables for use by the example"></a>

```c
/* Define an enumerated type used to identify the source of the data. */
typedef enum
{
    eSender1,
    eSender2
} DataSource_t;

/* Define the structure type that will be passed on the queue. */
typedef struct
{
    uint8_t ucValue;
    DataSource_t eDataSource;
} Data_t;

/* Declare two variables of type Data_t that will be passed on the queue. */
static const Data_t xStructsToSend[ 2 ] =
{
    { 100, eSender1 }, /* Used by Sender1. */
    { 200, eSender2 }  /* Used by Sender2. */
};
```
***Listing 5.9*** *The definition of the structure that is to be passed on a queue, plus the declaration of two variables for use by the example*

In Example 5.1, the receiving task has the highest priority, so the queue
never contains more than one item. This happens because the receiving task
pre-empts the sending tasks as soon as data is placed into the queue.
In Example 5.2, the sending tasks have the higher priority, so the queue
will normally be full. This is because, as soon as the receiving task
removes an item from the queue, it is pre-empted by one of the sending
tasks which then immediately re-fills the queue. The sending task then
re-enters the Blocked state to wait for space to become available on the
queue again.

Listing 5.10 shows the implementation of the sending task. The sending
task specifies a block time of 100 milliseconds, so it enters the
Blocked state to wait for space to become available each time the queue
becomes full. It leaves the Blocked state when either space is available
on the queue, or 100 milliseconds passes without space becoming
available. In this example, the receiving tasks continuously make space
in the queue, so the 100 milliseconds timeout never expires.

<a name="list5.10" title="Listing 5.10 The implementation of the sending task for Example 5.2"></a>

```c
static void vSenderTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    BaseType_t xStatus;
    const TickType_t xTicksToWait = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 100 );

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Send to the queue.

           The second parameter is the address of the structure being sent. The
           address is passed in as the task parameter so pvParameters is used
           directly.

           The third parameter is the Block time - the time the task should be 
           kept in the Blocked state to wait for space to become available on 
           the queue if the queue is already full. A block time is specified 
           because the sending tasks have a higher priority than the receiving 
           task so the queue is expected to become full. The receiving task 
           will remove items from the queue when both sending tasks are in the 
           Blocked state. */
        xStatus = xQueueSendToBack( xQueue, pvParameters, xTicksToWait );

        if( xStatus != pdPASS )
        {
            /* The send operation could not complete, even after waiting for 
               100ms. This must be an error as the receiving task should make 
               space in the queue as soon as both sending tasks are in the 
               Blocked state. */
            vPrintString( "Could not send to the queue.\r\n" );
        }
    }
}
```
***Listing 5.10*** *The implementation of the sending task for Example 5.2*


The receiving task has the lowest priority so it only runs only when both
sending tasks are in the Blocked state. The sending tasks only enter the
Blocked state when the queue is full, so the receiving task will only
execute when the queue is already full. Therefore, it always expects to
receive data even when it does not specify a block time.

Listing 5.11 shows the implementation of the receiving task.

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Because it has the lowest priority this task will only run when the
           sending tasks are in the Blocked state. The sending tasks will only
           enter the Blocked state when the queue is full so this task always 
           expects the number of items in the queue to be equal to the queue 
           length, which is 3 in this case. */

        }

        /* Receive from the queue.

           The second parameter is the buffer into which the received data will
           be placed. In this case the buffer is simply the address of a 
           variable that has the required size to hold the received structure.

           The last parameter is the block time - the maximum amount of time 
           that the task will remain in the Blocked state to wait for data to 
           be available if the queue is already empty. In this case a block 
           time is not necessary because this task will only run when the 
           queue is full. */

`main()` changes only slightly from the previous example. The queue is
created to hold three `Data_t` structures, and the priorities of the
sending and receiving tasks are reversed. Listing 5.12 shows the
implementation of `main()`.

**Key to Figure 5.6**

- t1

  Task Sender 1 executes and sends 3 data items to the queue.

- t2

  The queue is full so Sender 1 enters the Blocked state to wait for
  its next send to complete. Task Sender 2 is now the highest priority
  task that can run, so it enters the Running state.

- t3

  Task Sender 2 finds the queue is already full, so it enters the Blocked
  state to wait for its first send to complete. Task Receiver is now the
  highest priority task that can run, so it enters the Running state.

- t4

  Two tasks that have a priority higher than the receiving task's
  priority are waiting for space to become available on the queue,
  resulting in task Receiver being pre-empted as soon as it has removed
  one item from the queue. Tasks Sender 1 and Sender 2 have the same
  priority, so the scheduler selects the task that has been waiting the
  longest as the task that will enter the Running state—in this case that
  is task Sender 1.

- t5

  Task Sender 1 sends another data item to the queue. There was
  only one space in the queue, so task Sender 1 enters the Blocked state
  to wait for its next send to complete. Task Receiver is again the
  highest priority task that can run so it enters the Running state.

  Task Sender 1 has now sent four items to the queue, and task Sender 2
  is still waiting to send its first item to the queue.

- t6

  Two tasks that have a priority higher than the receiving task's
  priority are waiting for space to become available on the queue, so task
  Receiver is pre-empted as soon as it has removed one item from the
  queue. This time Sender 2 has been waiting longer than Sender 1, so
  Sender 2 enters the Running state.

- t7

  Task Sender 2 sends a data item to the queue. There was only one
  space in the queue so Sender 2 enters the Blocked state to wait for its
  next send to complete. Both tasks Sender 1 and Sender 2 are waiting for
  space to become available on the queue, so task Receiver is the only
  task that can enter the Running state.


## 5.5 Working with Large or Variable Sized Data

### 5.5.1 Queuing Pointers

If the size of the data stored in the queue is large, then it is
preferable to use the queue to transfer pointers to the data, rather
than copy the data itself into and out of the queue byte by byte.
Transferring pointers is more efficient in both processing time and the
amount of RAM required to create the queue. However, when queuing
pointers, extreme care must be taken to ensure that:

- The owner of the RAM being pointed to is clearly defined.

  When sharing memory between tasks via a pointer, it is essential to
  ensure both tasks do not modify the memory contents simultaneously, or
  take any other action that could cause the memory contents to be invalid
  or inconsistent. Ideally, only the sending task should be permitted to
  access the memory before the pointer is sent to the queue, and only the
  receiving task should be permitted to access the memory after the
  pointer has been received from the queue.

- The RAM being pointed to remains valid.

  If the memory being pointed to was allocated dynamically, or obtained
  from a pool of pre-allocated buffers, then exactly one task should be
  responsible for freeing the memory. No tasks should attempt to access
  the memory after it has been freed.

  A pointer should never be used to access data that has been allocated on
  a task stack. The data will not be valid after the stack frame has
  changed.

By way of example, Listings 5.13, 5.14 and 5.15 demonstrate how
to use a queue to send a pointer to a buffer from one task to another:

- Listing 5.13 creates a queue that can hold up to 5 pointers.

- Listing 5.14 allocates a buffer, writes a string to the buffer, then
  sends a pointer to the buffer to the queue.

- Listing 5.15 receives a pointer to a buffer from the queue, then
  prints the string contained in the buffer.

<a name="list5.13" title="Listing 5.13 Creating a queue that holds pointers"></a>

```c
/* Declare a variable of type QueueHandle_t to hold the handle of the
   queue being created. */
QueueHandle_t xPointerQueue;

/* Create a queue that can hold a maximum of 5 pointers, in this case
   character pointers. */
xPointerQueue = xQueueCreate( 5, sizeof( char * ) );
```

### 5.5.2 Using a Queue to Send Different Types and Lengths of Data[^9]

[^9]: FreeRTOS message buffers are a lighter weight alternative to
queues that hold variable length data.

Previous sections of this book demonstrated two powerful design
patterns; sending structures to a queue, and sending pointers to a
queue. Combining those techniques allows a task to use a single queue to
receive any data type from any data source. The implementation of the
FreeRTOS+TCP TCP/IP stack provides a practical example of how this is
achieved.

The TCP/IP stack, which runs in its own task, must process events from
many different sources. Different event types are associated with
different types and lengths of data. `IPStackEvent_t` structures describe
all events that occur outside of the TCP/IP task, and are sent to the
TCP/IP task on a queue. Listing 5.16 shows the `IPStackEvent_t` structure.
The `pvData` member of the `IPStackEvent_t` structure is a pointer that can
be used to hold a value directly, or point to a buffer.

<a name="list5.16" title="Listing 5.16 The structure used to send events to the TCP/IP stack task in FreeRTOS+TCP"></a>

```c
/* A subset of the enumerated types used in the TCP/IP stack to
   identify events. */
typedef enum
{
    eNetworkDownEvent = 0, /* The network interface has been lost, or needs
                              (re)connecting. */
    eNetworkRxEvent,       /* A packet has been received from the network. */
    eTCPAcceptEvent,       /* FreeRTOS_accept() called to accept or wait for a
                              new client. */

/* Other event types appear here but are not shown in this listing. */

} eIPEvent_t;

/* The structure that describes events, and is sent on a queue to the
   TCP/IP task. */
typedef struct IP_TASK_COMMANDS
{
    /* An enumerated type that identifies the event. See the eIPEvent_t
       definition above. */
    eIPEvent_t eEventType;

    /* A generic pointer that can hold a value, or point to a buffer. */
    void *pvData;

} IPStackEvent_t;
```
***Listing 5.16*** *The structure used to send events to the TCP/IP stack task in FreeRTOS+TCP*

Example TCP/IP events, and their associated data, include:

- `eNetworkRxEvent`: A packet of data was received from the network.

  The network interface sends data received events to the TCP/IP task
  using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's `eEventType`
  member is set to `eNetworkRxEvent`, and the structure's `pvData` member is
  used to point to the buffer that contains the received data. Listing
  59 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.17" title="Listing 5.17 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send data received from the network to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendRxDataToTheTCPTask( NetworkBufferDescriptor_t *pxRxedData )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;
  
      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. The received data is stored in
         pxRxedData. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eNetworkRxEvent;
      xEventStruct.pvData = ( void * ) pxRxedData;
  
      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.17*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send data received from the network to the TCP/IP task*

- `eTCPAcceptEvent`: A socket is to accept, or wait for, a connection
  from a client.

  The task that called `FreeRTOS_accept()` sends accept events to the
  TCP/IP task using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's
  `eEventType` member is set to `eTCPAcceptEvent`, and the structure's
  `pvData` member is set to the handle of the socket that is accepting a
  connection. Listing 5.18 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.18" title="Listing 5.18 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send the handle of a socket that is accepting a connection to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendAcceptRequestToTheTCPTask( Socket_t xSocket )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;

      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eTCPAcceptEvent;
      xEventStruct.pvData = ( void * ) xSocket;

      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.18*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send the handle of a socket that is accepting a connection to the TCP/IP task*
  
- `eNetworkDownEvent`: The network needs connecting, or re-connecting.

  The network interface sends network down events to the TCP/IP task
  using a structure of type `IPStackEvent_t`. The structure's `eEventType`
  member is set to `eNetworkDownEvent`. Network down events are not
  associated with any data, so the structure's `pvData` member is not
  used. Listing 5.19 shows a pseudo code example.

  <a name="list5.19" title="Listing 5.19 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send a network down event to the TCP/IP task"></a>

  ```c
  void vSendNetworkDownEventToTheTCPTask( Socket_t xSocket )
  {
      IPStackEvent_t xEventStruct;

      /* Complete the IPStackEvent_t structure. */
      xEventStruct.eEventType = eNetworkDownEvent;

      xEventStruct.pvData = NULL; /* Not used, but set to NULL for
                                     completeness. */

      /* Send the IPStackEvent_t structure to the TCP/IP task. */
      xSendEventStructToIPTask( &xEventStruct );
  }
  ```
  ***Listing 5.19*** *Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is used to send a network down event to the TCP/IP task*
  
  Listing 5.20 shows the code that receives and processes these events
  within the TCP/IP task. It can be seen that the `eEventType` member of the
  `IPStackEvent_t` structures received from the queue is used to determine
  how the `pvData` member is to be interpreted.

  <a name="list5.20" title="Listing 5.20 Pseudo code showing how an IPStackEvent_t structure is received and processed"></a>

  ```c
  IPStackEvent_t xReceivedEvent;

  /* Block on the network event queue until either an event is received, or 
     xNextIPSleep ticks pass without an event being received. eEventType is 
     set to eNoEvent in case the call to xQueueReceive() returns because it 
     timed out, rather than because an event was received. */
  xReceivedEvent.eEventType = eNoEvent;
  xQueueReceive( xNetworkEventQueue, &xReceivedEvent, xNextIPSleep );

  /* Which event was received, if any? */
  switch( xReceivedEvent.eEventType )
  {
      case eNetworkDownEvent :
           /* Attempt to (re)establish a connection. This event is not 
              associated with any data. */
           prvProcessNetworkDownEvent();
           break;

      case eNetworkRxEvent:

           break;

      /* Other event types are processed in the same way, but are not shown
         here. */

  }

## 5.6 Receiving From Multiple Queues

### 5.6.1 Queue Sets

Often application designs require a single task to receive data of
different sizes, data with different meanings, and data from different
sources. The previous section demonstrated how to do this in a neat and
efficient way using a single queue that receives structures. However,
sometimes an application's designer is working with constraints that
limit their design choices, necessitating the use of a separate queue
for some data sources. For example, third party code being integrated
into a design might assume the presence of a dedicated queue. In such
cases a 'queue set' can be used.

Queue sets allow a task to receive data from more than one queue without
the task polling each queue in turn to determine which, if any, contains
data.

A design that uses a queue set to receive data from multiple sources is
less neat, and less efficient, than a design that achieves the same
functionality using a single queue that receives structures. For that
reason, it is recommended to only use queue sets if design constraints
make their use absolutely necessary.

The following sections describe how to use a queue set by:

- Creating a queue set.

- Adding queues to the set.

  Semaphores can also be added to a queue set. Semaphores are described later in this book.

- Reading from the queue set to determine which queues within the set contain data.

  When a queue that is a member of a set receives data, the handle of
  the receiving queue is sent to the queue set, and returned when a
  task calls a function that reads from the queue set. Therefore, if a
  queue handle is returned from a queue set, then the queue referenced
  by the handle is known to contain data, and the task can then read
  from that queue directly.

  > *Note: If a queue is a member of a queue set then you must read from
  > the queue each time its handle is received from the queue set, and you
  > must not read from the queue before its handle is received from the
  > queue set.*

Queue set functionality is enabled by setting the `configUSE_QUEUE_SETS`
compile time configuration constant to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.


### 5.6.2 The xQueueCreateSet() API Function

A queue set must be explicitly created before it can be used. At the
time of writing there is no implementation of `xQueueCreateSetStatic()`.
However queue sets are themselves queues, so it is possible to create a
set using pre-allocated memory by using a specially crafted call to
`xQueueCreateStatic()`.

Queues sets are referenced by handles, which are variables of type
`QueueSetHandle_t`. The `xQueueCreateSet()` API function creates a queue set
and returns a `QueueSetHandle_t` that references the created queue set.

<a name="list5.21" title="Listing 5.21 The xQueueCreateSet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
QueueSetHandle_t xQueueCreateSet( const UBaseType_t uxEventQueueLength);
```
***Listing 5.21*** *The xQueueCreateSet() API function prototype*


**xQueueCreateSet() parameters and return value**

- `uxEventQueueLength`

  When a queue that is a member of a queue set receives data, the
  handle of the receiving queue is sent to the queue set.
  `uxEventQueueLength` defines the maximum number of queue handles the queue
  set being created can hold at any one time.

  Queue handles are only sent to a queue set when a queue within the
  set receives data. A queue cannot receive data if it is full, so no
  queue handles can be sent to the queue set if all the queues in the set
  are full. Therefore, the maximum number of items the queue set will ever
  have to hold at one time is the sum of the lengths of every queue in the
  set.

  As an example, if there are three empty queues in the set, and each
  queue has a length of five, then in total the queues in the set can
  receive fifteen items (three queues multiplied by five items each)
  before all the queues in the set are full. In that example
  `uxEventQueueLength` must be set to fifteen to guarantee the queue set can
  receive every item sent to it.

  Semaphores can also be added to a queue set. Semaphores are covered
  later in this book. For the purposes of calculating the necessary
  `uxEventQueueLength`, the length of a binary semaphore is one, the length
  of a mutex is one, and the length of a counting semaphore is given by
  the semaphore's maximum count value.

  As another example, if a queue set will contain a queue that has a
  length of three, and a binary semaphore (which has a length of one),
  `uxEventQueueLength` must be set to four (three plus one).

- Return Value

  If NULL is returned, then the queue set cannot be created because
  there is insufficient heap memory available for FreeRTOS to allocate the
  queue set data structures and storage area. Chapter 3 provides more
  information on the FreeRTOS heap.

  If a non-NULL value is returned then the queue set was created
  successfully and the returned value is the handle to the created queue set.


### 5.6.3 The xQueueAddToSet() API Function

`xQueueAddToSet()` adds a queue or semaphore to a queue set. Semaphores
are described later in this book.

<a name="list5.22" title="Listing 5.22 The xQueueAddToSet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueueAddToSet( QueueSetMemberHandle_t xQueueOrSemaphore,
                           QueueSetHandle_t xQueueSet );
```
***Listing 5.22*** *The xQueueAddToSet() API function prototype*

**xQueueAddToSet() parameters and return value**

- `xQueueOrSemaphore`

  The handle of the queue or semaphore that is being added to the queue set.

  Queue handles and semaphore handles can both be cast to the `QueueSetMemberHandle_t` type.

- `xQueueSet`

  The handle of the queue set to which the queue or semaphore is being added.

- Return Value

  There are two possible return values:

  1. `pdPASS`

      This indicates the queue set was created successfully.

  1. `pdFAIL`

     This indicates the queue or semaphore could not be added to the queue set.

  Queues and binary semaphores can only be added to a set when they are
  empty. Counting semaphores can only be added to a set when their count
  is zero. Queues and semaphores can only be a member of one set at a time.


### 5.6.4 The xQueueSelectFromSet() API Function

`xQueueSelectFromSet()` reads a queue handle from the queue set.

When a queue or semaphore that is a member of a set receives data, the
handle of the receiving queue or semaphore is sent to the queue set, and
returned when a task calls `xQueueSelectFromSet()`. If a handle is
returned from a call to `xQueueSelectFromSet()` then the queue or
semaphore referenced by the handle is known to contain data and the
calling task must then read from the queue or semaphore directly.

> *Note: Do not read data from a queue or semaphore that is a member of a
> set unless the handle of the queue or semaphore has first been returned
> from a call to `xQueueSelectFromSet()`. Only read one item from a queue or
> semaphore each time the queue handle or semaphore handle is returned
> from a call to `xQueueSelectFromSet()`.*

<a name="list5.23" title="Listing 5.23 The xQueueSelectFromSet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
QueueSetMemberHandle_t xQueueSelectFromSet( QueueSetHandle_t xQueueSet,
                                            const TickType_t xTicksToWait );
```
***Listing 5.23*** *The xQueueSelectFromSet() API function prototype*

**xQueueSelectFromSet() parameters and return value**

- `xQueueSet`

  The handle of the queue set from which a queue handle or semaphore
  handle is being received (read). The queue set handle will have been
  returned from the call to `xQueueCreateSet()` used to create the queue
  set.

- `xTicksToWait`

  The maximum amount of time the calling task should remain in the
  Blocked state to wait to receive a queue or semaphore handle from the
  queue set, if all the queues and semaphore in the set are empty.

  If `xTicksToWait` is zero then `xQueueSelectFromSet()` will return
  immediately if all the queues and semaphores in the set are empty.

  The block time is specified in tick periods, so the absolute time it
  represents is dependent on the tick frequency. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
  can be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds to a time
  specified in ticks.

  Setting `xTicksToWait` to `portMAX_DELAY` will cause the task to wait
  indefinitely (without timing out) provided `INCLUDE_vTaskSuspend` is set
  to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

- Return Value

  A return value that is not NULL will be the handle of a queue or
  semaphore that is known to contain data. If a block time was specified
  (`xTicksToWait` was not zero), then it is possible the calling task was
  placed into the Blocked state to wait for data to become available from
  a queue or semaphore in the set, but a handle was successfully read from
  the queue set before the block time expired. Handles are returned as a
  `QueueSetMemberHandle_t` type, which can be cast to either a `QueueHandle_t`
  type or `SemaphoreHandle_t` type.

  If the return value is NULL then a handle could not be read from the
  queue set. If a block time was specified (`xTicksToWait` was not zero)
  then the calling task was placed in the Blocked state to
  wait for another task or interrupt to send data to a queue or semaphore
  in the set, but the block time expired before that happened.

***Example 5.3*** *Using a Queue Set</i></h3>

---

This example creates two sending tasks and one receiving task. The
sending tasks send data to the receiving task on two separate queues,
one queue for each task. The two queues are added to a queue set, and
the receiving task reads from the queue set to determine which of the
two queues contain data.

The tasks, queues, and the queue set are all created in `main()`—see
Listing 5.24 for its implementation.

<a name="list5.24" title="Listing 5.24  Implementation of main() for Example 5.3"></a>

```c
/* Declare two variables of type QueueHandle_t. Both queues are added
   to the same queue set. */
static QueueHandle_t xQueue1 = NULL, xQueue2 = NULL;

/* Declare a variable of type QueueSetHandle_t. This is the queue set
   to which the two queues are added. */
static QueueSetHandle_t xQueueSet = NULL;

int main( void )
{
    /* Create the two queues, both of which send character pointers. The 
       priority of the receiving task is above the priority of the sending 
       tasks, so the queues will never have more than one item in them at 
       any one time*/
    xQueue1 = xQueueCreate( 1, sizeof( char * ) );
    xQueue2 = xQueueCreate( 1, sizeof( char * ) );

    /* Create the queue set. Two queues will be added to the set, each of
       which can contain 1 item, so the maximum number of queue handles the 
       queue set will ever have to hold at one time is 2 (2 queues multiplied 
       by 1 item per queue). */
    xQueueSet = xQueueCreateSet( 1 * 2 );

    /* Add the two queues to the set. */
    xQueueAddToSet( xQueue1, xQueueSet );
    xQueueAddToSet( xQueue2, xQueueSet );

    /* Create the tasks that send to the queues. */
    xTaskCreate( vSenderTask1, "Sender1", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );
    xTaskCreate( vSenderTask2, "Sender2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );

    /* Create the task that reads from the queue set to determine which of
       the two queues contain data. */
    xTaskCreate( vReceiverTask, "Receiver", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL );

    /* Start the scheduler so the created tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /* As normal, vTaskStartScheduler() should not return, so the following
       lines will never execute. */
    for( ;; );
    return 0;
}
```
***Listing 5.24*** *Implementation of main() for Example 5.3*

The first sending task uses `xQueue1` to send a character pointer to the
receiving task every 100 milliseconds. The second sending task uses
`xQueue2` to send a character pointer to the receiving task every 200
milliseconds. The character pointers point to a string that identifies
the sending task. Listing 5.25 shows the implementation of both tasks.

<a name="list5.25" title="Listing 5.25 The sending tasks used in Example 5.3"></a>

```c
void vSenderTask1( void *pvParameters )
{
    const TickType_t xBlockTime = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 100 );
    const char * const pcMessage = "Message from vSenderTask1\r\n";

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */

    for( ;; )
    {

        /* Block for 100ms. */
        vTaskDelay( xBlockTime );

        /* Send this task's string to xQueue1. It is not necessary to use a
           block time, even though the queue can only hold one item. This is 
           because the priority of the task that reads from the queue is 
           higher than the priority of this task; as soon as this task writes 
           to the queue it will be pre-empted by the task that reads from the 
           queue, so the queue will already be empty again by the time the 
           call to xQueueSend() returns. The block time is set to 0. */
        xQueueSend( xQueue1, &pcMessage, 0 );
    }
}

/*-----------------------------------------------------------*/

void vSenderTask2( void *pvParameters )
{
    const TickType_t xBlockTime = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 200 );
    const char * const pcMessage = "Message from vSenderTask2\r\n";

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Block for 200ms. */
        vTaskDelay( xBlockTime );

        /* Send this task's string to xQueue2. It is not necessary to use a
           block time, even though the queue can only hold one item. This is

           higher than the priority of this task; as soon as this task writes 
           to the queue it will be pre-empted by the task that reads from the 
           queue, so the queue will already be empty again by the time the 
           call to xQueueSend() returns. The block time is set to 0. */
        xQueueSend( xQueue2, &pcMessage, 0 );
    }
}
```
***Listing 5.25*** *The sending tasks used in Example 5.3*


The queues written to by the sending tasks are members of the same queue
set. Each time a task sends to one of the queues, the handle of the
queue is sent to the queue set. The receiving task calls
`xQueueSelectFromSet()` to read the queue handles from the queue set.
After the receiving task receives a queue handle from the set, it knows
the queue referenced by the received handle contains data, so it reads the
data from the queue directly. The data it reads from the queue is a
pointer to a string, which the receiving task prints out.

If a call to `xQueueSelectFromSet()` times out, it returns NULL. In Example
5.3, `xQueueSelectFromSet()` is called with an indefinite block time, so it
will never time out, and can only return a valid queue handle.
Therefore, the receiving task does not need to check to see if
`xQueueSelectFromSet()` returned NULL before using the returned value.

`xQueueSelectFromSet()` only returns a queue handle if the queue
referenced by the handle contains data, so it is not necessary to use a
block time when reading from the queue.

Listing 5.26 shows the implementation of the receive task.

<a name="list5.26" title="Listing 5.26 The receive task used in Example 5.3"></a>

```c
void vReceiverTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    QueueHandle_t xQueueThatContainsData;
    char *pcReceivedString;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented within an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Block on the queue set to wait for one of the queues in the set to
           contain data. Cast the QueueSetMemberHandle_t value returned from
           xQueueSelectFromSet() to a QueueHandle_t, as it is known all the 
           members of the set are queues (the queue set does not contain any 
           semaphores). */
        xQueueThatContainsData = ( QueueHandle_t ) xQueueSelectFromSet(
                                                     xQueueSet, portMAX_DELAY );

        /* An indefinite block time was used when reading from the queue set,
           so xQueueSelectFromSet() will not have returned unless one of the 
           queues in the set contained data, and xQueueThatContainsData cannot
           be NULL. Read from the queue. It is not necessary to specify a 
           block time because it is known the queue contains data. The block 
           time is set to 0. */
        xQueueReceive( xQueueThatContainsData, &pcReceivedString, 0 );

        /* Print the string received from the queue. */
        vPrintString( pcReceivedString );
    }
}
```
***Listing 5.26*** *The receive task used in Example 5.3*

Figure 5.7 shows the output produced by Example 5.3. It can be seen that
the receiving task receives strings from both sending tasks. The block
time used by `vSenderTask1()` is half of the block time used by
`vSenderTask2()`, which causes the strings sent by `vSenderTask1()` to print out
twice as often as those sent by `vSenderTask2()`.

### 5.6.5 More Realistic Queue Set Use Cases

Example 5.3 demonstrated a very simplistic case; the queue set only
contained queues, and the two queues it contained were both used to send
a character pointer. In a real application, a queue set might contain
both queues and semaphores, and the queues might not all hold the same
data type. When this is the case, it is necessary to test the value
returned by `xQueueSelectFromSet()`, before using the returned value.
Listing 5.27 demonstrates how to use the value returned from
`xQueueSelectFromSet()` when the set has the following members:

- A binary semaphore.
- A queue from which character pointers are read.
- A queue from which `uint32_t` values are read.

Listing 5.27 assumes the queues and semaphore have already been created
and added to the queue set.

<a name="list5.27" title="Listing 5.27 Using a queue set that contains queues and semaphores"></a>

```c
/* The handle of the queue from which character pointers are received. */
QueueHandle_t xCharPointerQueue;

/* The handle of the queue from which uint32_t values are received. */
QueueHandle_t xUint32tQueue;

/* The handle of the binary semaphore. */
SemaphoreHandle_t xBinarySemaphore;

/* The queue set to which the two queues and the binary semaphore belong. */
QueueSetHandle_t xQueueSet;

void vAMoreRealisticReceiverTask( void *pvParameters )
{
    QueueSetMemberHandle_t xHandle;
    char *pcReceivedString;
    uint32_t ulRecievedValue;
    const TickType_t xDelay100ms = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 100 );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Block on the queue set for a maximum of 100ms to wait for one of the
           members of the set to contain data. */
        xHandle = xQueueSelectFromSet( xQueueSet, xDelay100ms );

        /* Test the value returned from xQueueSelectFromSet(). If the returned
           value is NULL then the call to xQueueSelectFromSet() timed out. If 
           the returned value is not NULL then the returned value will be the 
           handle of one of the set's members. The QueueSetMemberHandle_t 
           value can be cast to either a QueueHandle_t or a SemaphoreHandle_t.
           Whether an explicit cast is required depends on the compiler. */

        if( xHandle == NULL )
        {
            /* The call to xQueueSelectFromSet() timed out. */
        }
        else if( xHandle == ( QueueSetMemberHandle_t ) xCharPointerQueue )
        {
            /* The call to xQueueSelectFromSet() returned the handle of the 
               queue that receives character pointers. Read from the queue. 
               The queue is known to contain data, so a block time of 0 is 
               used. */
            xQueueReceive( xCharPointerQueue, &pcReceivedString, 0 );

            /* The received character pointer can be processed here... */
        }

        {
            /* The call to xQueueSelectFromSet() returned the handle of the 
               queue that receives uint32_t types. Read from the queue. The

            xQueueReceive(xUint32tQueue, &ulRecievedValue, 0 );

            /* The received value can be processed here... */
        }

        {
            /* The call to xQueueSelectFromSet() returned the handle of the 
               binary semaphore. Take the semaphore now. The semaphore is

            /* Whatever processing is necessary when the semaphore is taken 
               can be performed here... */
        }
    }
}

## 5.7 Using a Queue to Create a Mailbox

There is no consensus on terminology within the embedded community, and
'mailbox' will mean different things in different RTOSes. In this book,
the term mailbox is used to refer to a queue that has a length of one. A
queue may be described as a mailbox because of the way it is used in
the application, rather than because it has a functional difference to a
queue:

- A queue is used to send data from one task to another task, or from
  an interrupt service routine to a task. The sender places an item in
  the queue, and the receiver removes the item from the queue. The
  data passes through the queue from the sender to the receiver.

- A mailbox is used to hold data that can be read by any task, or any
  interrupt service routine. The data does not pass through the
  mailbox, but instead remains in the mailbox until it is overwritten.
  The sender overwrites the value in the mailbox. The receiver reads
  the value from the mailbox, but does not remove the value from the
  mailbox.

This chapter describes two queue API functions that enable a queue to be
used as a mailbox.

Listing 5.28 shows how a queue is created for use as a mailbox.

<a name="list5.28" title="Listing 5.28 A queue being created for use as a mailbox"></a>

```c
/* A mailbox can hold a fixed size data item. The size of the data item is set
   when the mailbox (queue) is created. In this example the mailbox is created 
   to hold an Example_t structure. Example_t includes a time stamp to allow the
   data held in the mailbox to note the time at which the mailbox was last 
   updated. The time stamp used in this example is for demonstration purposes 
   only - a mailbox can hold any data the application writer wants, and the 
   data does not need to include a time stamp. */
typedef struct xExampleStructure
{
    TickType_t xTimeStamp;
    uint32_t ulValue;
} Example_t;

/* A mailbox is a queue, so its handle is stored in a variable of type
   QueueHandle_t. */
QueueHandle_t xMailbox;

void vAFunction( void )
{
    /* Create the queue that is going to be used as a mailbox. The queue has 
       a length of 1 to allow it to be used with the xQueueOverwrite() API 
       function, which is described below. */
    xMailbox = xQueueCreate( 1, sizeof( Example_t ) );
}
```
***Listing 5.28*** *A queue being created for use as a mailbox*


### 5.7.1 The xQueueOverwrite() API Function

Like the `xQueueSendToBack()` API function, the `xQueueOverwrite()` API
function sends data to a queue. Unlike `xQueueSendToBack()`, if the queue
is already full, then `xQueueOverwrite()` overwrites data that is already
in the queue.

`xQueueOverwrite()` must only be used with queues that have a length of
one. The overwrite mode will always write to the front of the queue and
update the front of queue pointer, but it will not update the messages
waiting.  If `configASSERT` is defined, an assert will occur if the queue
has a length &gt; 1.

> *Note: Never call `xQueueOverwrite()` from an interrupt service routine.
> The interrupt-safe version `xQueueOverwriteFromISR()` should be used in
> its place.*

<a name="list5.29" title="Listing 5.29 The xQueueOverwrite() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueueOverwrite( QueueHandle_t xQueue, const void * pvItemToQueue );
```
***Listing 5.29*** *The xQueueOverwrite() API function prototype*

**xQueueOverwrite() parameters and return value**

- `xQueue`

  The handle of the queue to which the data is being sent (written). The queue handle 
  will have been returned from the call to `xQueueCreate()` or `xQueueCreateStatic()` 
  used to create the queue.

- `pvItemToQueue`

   A pointer to the data to be copied into the queue.

   The size of each item that the queue can hold is set when the queue is
   created, so this many bytes will be copied from `pvItemToQueue` into the
   queue storage area.

- Return value

  `xQueueOverwrite()` writes to the queue even when the queue is full,
  so `pdPASS` is the only possible return value.

Listing 5.30 shows how `xQueueOverwrite()` is used to write to the mailbox
(queue) created in Listing 5.28.

<a name="list5.30" title="Listing 5.30 Using the xQueueOverwrite() API function"></a>

```c
void vUpdateMailbox( uint32_t ulNewValue )
{
    /* Example_t was defined in Listing 5.28. */
    Example_t xData;

    /* Write the new data into the Example_t structure.*/
    xData.ulValue = ulNewValue;

    /* Use the RTOS tick count as the time stamp stored in the Example_t
       structure. */
    xData.xTimeStamp = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* Send the structure to the mailbox - overwriting any data that is 
       already in the mailbox. */
    xQueueOverwrite( xMailbox, &xData );
}
```
***Listing 5.30*** *Using the xQueueOverwrite() API function*


### 5.7.2 The xQueuePeek() API Function

`xQueuePeek()` receives (reads) an item from a queue *without* removing
the item from the queue. `xQueuePeek()` receives data from the head of the
queue without modifying the data stored in the queue, or the order in
which data is stored in the queue.

> *Note: Never call `xQueuePeek()` from an interrupt service routine. The
> interrupt-safe version `xQueuePeekFromISR()` should be used in its place.*

*`xQueuePeek()` has the same function parameters and return value as
`xQueueReceive()`.*

<a name="list5.31" title="Listing 5.31 The xQueuePeek() API function prototype"></a>

```c
BaseType_t xQueuePeek( QueueHandle_t xQueue,
                       void * const pvBuffer,

***Listing 5.31*** *The xQueuePeek() API function prototype*


Listing 5.32 shows `xQueuePeek()` being used to receive the item posted to
the mailbox (queue) in Listing 5.30.

<a name="list5.32" title="Listing 5.32 Using the xQueuePeek() API function"></a>

```c
BaseType_t vReadMailbox( Example_t *pxData )
{
    TickType_t xPreviousTimeStamp;
    BaseType_t xDataUpdated;

    /* This function updates an Example_t structure with the latest value
       received from the mailbox. Record the time stamp already contained in 
       *pxData before it gets overwritten by the new data. */
    xPreviousTimeStamp = pxData->xTimeStamp;

    /* Update the Example_t structure pointed to by pxData with the data
       contained in the mailbox. If xQueueReceive() was used here then the 
       mailbox would be left empty, and the data could not then be read by 
       any other tasks. Using xQueuePeek() instead of xQueueReceive() ensures 
       the data remains in the mailbox.

       A block time is specified, so the calling task will be placed in the
       Blocked state to wait for the mailbox to contain data should the mailbox
       be empty. An infinite block time is used, so it is not necessary to 
       check the value returned from xQueuePeek(), as xQueuePeek() will only 
       return when data is available. */
    xQueuePeek( xMailbox, pxData, portMAX_DELAY );

    /* Return pdTRUE if the value read from the mailbox has been updated since
       this function was last called. Otherwise return pdFALSE. */
    if( pxData->xTimeStamp > xPreviousTimeStamp )
    {
        xDataUpdated = pdTRUE;
    }
    else
    {
        xDataUpdated = pdFALSE;
    }

    return xDataUpdated;
}
