# 4 Task Management

## 4.1 Introduction

### 4.1.1 Scope

This chapter covers:

- How FreeRTOS allocates processing time to each task in an application.
- How FreeRTOS chooses which task should execute at any given time.
- How the relative priority of each task affects system behavior.
- The states that a task can exist in.

This chapter also discusses:

- How to implement tasks.
- How to create one or more instances of a task.
- How to use the task parameter.
- How to change the priority of a task that has already been created.
- How to delete a task.
- How to implement periodic processing using a task. (A later chapter
  describes how to do the same using software timers.)
- When the idle task will execute and how it can be used.

The concepts presented in this chapter are fundamental to understanding
how to use FreeRTOS and how FreeRTOS applications behave. Therefore,
this is the most detailed chapter in the book.

## 4.2 Task Functions

Tasks are implemented as C functions. Tasks must implement the expected function
prototype shown in Listing 4.1. which takes a void pointer parameter and returns
void.

<a name="list4.1" title="Listing 4.1 The task function prototype"></a>

```c
void vATaskFunction( void * pvParameters );
```

***Listing 4.1*** *The task function prototype*


Each task is a small program in its own right. It has an entry point,
will normally run forever in an infinite loop, and does not exit.
Listing 4.2 shows the structure of a typical task.

A FreeRTOS task must not be allowed to return from the function that implements
it in any way. It must not contain a 'return' statement and must
not be allowed to execute past the end of its implementing function.
If a task is no longer required, it should be explicitly deleted as
demonstrated in Listing 4.2.

A single task function definition can be used to create any number of
tasks where each created task is a separate execution instance. Each instance has
its own stack and thus its own copy of any automatic (stack) variables defined
within the task itself.


<a name="list4.2" title="Listing 4.2 The structure of a typical task function"></a>


```c
void vATaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{
    /*
     * Stack-allocated variables can be declared normally when inside a function.
     * Each instance of a task created using this example function will have its
     * own separate instance of lStackVariable allocated on the task's stack.
     */
    long lStackVariable = 0;

    /*
     * In contrast to stack allocated variables, variables declared with the `static`
     * keyword are allocated to a specific location in memory by the linker.
     * This means that all tasks calling vATaskFunction will share the same
     * instance of lStaticVariable.
     */
    static long lStaticVariable = 0;

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* The code to implement the task functionality will go here. */
    }

    /*
     * If the task implementation ever exits the above loop, then the task
     * must be deleted before reaching the end of its implementing function.
     * When NULL is passed as a parameter to the vTaskDelete() API function,
     * this indicates that the task to be deleted is the calling (this) task.
     */
    vTaskDelete( NULL );
}
```

***Listing 4.2*** *The structure of a typical task function*

## 4.3 Top Level Task States

An application may consist of many tasks. If the processor running the
application includes a single core, then only one task may be executing
at any given time. This implies that a task may exist in one of two
states: *Running* and *Not Running*. This simplistic model is considered
first. Later in this chapter we describe the several sub-states of the
*Not Running* state.

A task is in the *Running* state when the processor is executing that task's
code. When a task is in the *Not Running* state, the task is paused and its
state has been saved so that it may resume execution the next time the scheduler
decides it should enter the *Running* state. When a task resumes execution,
it does so from the instruction it was about to execute before it left the
*Running* state.


<a name="fig4.1" title="Figure 4.1 Top level task states and transitions"></a>

***
![](media/figure_4.1_top_level_task_states.png)
***Figure 4.1*** *Top level task states and transitions*
***

A task transitioned from the *Not Running* state to the *Running* state is
said to have been "switched in" or "swapped in". Conversely, a task
transitioned from the *Running* state to the *Not Running* state is said to
have been "switched out" or "swapped out". The FreeRTOS scheduler is the
only entity that can switch a task in and out of the *Running* state.

## 4.4 Task Creation

Six API functions may be used to create tasks:
`xTaskCreate()`,
`xTaskCreateStatic()`,
`xTaskCreateRestricted()`,
`xTaskCreateRestrictedStatic()`,
`xTaskCreateAffinitySet()`, and
`xTaskCreateStaticAffinitySet()`

Each task requires two blocks of RAM: one to hold its Task Control Block (TCB)
and one to store its stack. FreeRTOS API functions with "Static" in their names
use pre-allocated blocks of RAM passed into the functions as parameters.
Conversely, API functions without "Static" in their names allocate the required
RAM dynamically at runtime from the system heap.

Some FreeRTOS ports support tasks running in a "restricted" or "unprivileged" mode.
FreeRTOS API functions with "Restricted" in their names create tasks that
execute with limited access to the system's memory. API functions without
"Restricted" in their names create tasks that execute in "privileged mode" and
have access to the system's entire memory map.

FreeRTOS ports that support Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP) allow different tasks
to run simultaneously on multiple cores of the same CPU. For these ports, you may
specify which core a task will run on by using functions with "Affinity" in the name.

The FreeRTOS task creation API functions are quite complex. Most examples in this
document use `xTaskCreate()` because it is the simplest of these functions.

### 4.4.1 The xTaskCreate() API Function

Listing 4.3 shows the `xTaskCreate()` API function prototype.
`xTaskCreateStatic()` has two additional parameters that point to the
memory pre-allocated to hold the task's data structure and stack,
respectively. [Section 2.5: Data Types and Coding Style Guide](ch02.md#25-data-types-and-coding-style-guide)
describes the data types and naming conventions used.


<a name="list4.3" title="Listing 4.3 The xTaskCreate() API function prototype"></a>


```c
BaseType_t xTaskCreate( TaskFunction_t pvTaskCode,
                        const char * const pcName,
                        configSTACK_DEPTH_TYPE usStackDepth,
                        void * pvParameters,
                        UBaseType_t uxPriority,
                        TaskHandle_t * pxCreatedTask );
```

***Listing 4.3*** *The xTaskCreate() API function prototype*

**xTaskCreate() Parameters and return value:**

- `pvTaskCode`

  Tasks are simply C functions that never exit and, as such, are normally
  implemented as an infinite loop. The `pvTaskCode` parameter is simply a
  pointer to the function that implements the task (in effect, just the
  function's name).

- `pcName`

  A descriptive name for the task. FreeRTOS does not use this in
  any way and it is included purely as a debugging aid. Identifying a task by
  a human-readable name is much simpler than identifying it by its handle.

  The application-defined constant `configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN` defines the
  maximum length a task name can be, including the NULL terminator.
  Supplying a longer string results in the string being truncated.

- `usStackDepth`

  Specifies the size of the stack to allocate for use by the task.
  Use `xTaskCreateStatic()` instead of `xTaskCreate()` to use pre-allocated
  memory instead of dynamically allocated memory.

  Note the value specifies the number of words the stack can hold, not
  the number of bytes. For example, if the stack is 32-bits wide and
  `usStackDepth` is 128, then `xTaskCreate()` allocates 512 bytes of stack
  space (128 * 4 bytes).

  `configSTACK_DEPTH_TYPE` is a macro that allows the application writer
  to specify the data type used to hold stack sizes. `configSTACK_DEPTH_TYPE`
  defaults to `uint16_t` if left undefined, so #define `configSTACK_DEPTH_TYPE`
  to `unsigned long` or `size_t` in `FreeRTOSConfig.h` if the stack depth multiplied
  by the stack width is greater than 65535 (the largest possible 16-bit number).

  [Section 13.3 Stack Overflow](ch13.md#133-stack-overflow), describes a
  practical method of choosing an optimal stack size.

- `pvParameters`

  Functions that implement tasks accept a single void pointer (`void *`)
  parameter. `pvParameters` is the value passed into the task using that
  parameter.

- `uxPriority`

  Defines the task's priority. 0 is the lowest priority and
  `(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)` is the highest priority. [Section 4.5](#45-task-priorities)
  describes the user defined `configMAX_PRIORITIES` constant.

  If a `uxPriority` greater than `(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)` is defined, it will
  be capped to `(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)`.

- `pxCreatedTask`

  Pointer to a location to store a handle to the created task. This handle may
  be used in future API calls to, for example, change the task's priority or delete
  the task.

  `pxCreatedTask` is an optional parameter and may be set to NULL if the
  task's handle is not required.

- Return values

  There are two possible return values:

  - `pdPASS`

    This indicates the task was created successfully.

  - `pdFAIL`

    This indicates there was not enough heap memory available to create
    the task. [Chapter 3](ch03.md#3-heap-memory-management) provides more
    information on heap memory management.

***Example 4.1*** *Creating tasks*

---

The following example demonstrates the steps needed to create two simple tasks
and then start the newly created tasks. The tasks simply print out a string
periodically by using a crude busy loop to create the period delay. Both
tasks are created at the same priority and are identical except for the
string they print out—see Listing 4.4 and Listing 4.5 for their respective
implementations. See chapter 8 for warnings about using `printf()` in
tasks.

<a name="list4.4" title="Listing 4.4 Implementation of the first task used in Example 4.1"></a>


```c
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
{
    /* ulCount is declared volatile to ensure it is not optimized out. */
    volatile unsigned long ulCount;

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of the current task task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 1 is running" );

        /* Delay for a period. */
        for( ulCount = 0; ulCount < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ulCount++ )
        {
            /*
             * This loop is just a very crude delay implementation. There is
             * nothing to do in here. Later examples will replace this crude
             * loop with a proper delay/sleep function.
             */
        }
    }
}
```

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 2 is running" );

        /* Delay for a period. */
        for( ulCount = 0; ulCount < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ulCount++ )
        {
            /*
             * This loop is just a very crude delay implementation. There is

             */
        }
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.5*** *Implementation of the second task used in Example 4.1*

The main() function creates the tasks before starting the scheduler—see
Listing 4.6 for its implementation.


<a name="list4.6" title="Listing 4.6 Starting the Example 4.1 tasks"></a>


```c
int main( void )
{
    /*
     * Variables declared here may no longer exist after starting the FreeRTOS
     * scheduler. Do not attempt to access variables declared on the stack used
     * by main() from tasks.
     */

    /*
     * Create one of the two tasks. Note that a real application should check
     * the return value of the xTaskCreate() call to ensure the task was
     * created successfully.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask1,  /* Pointer to the function that implements the task.*/
                 "Task 1",/* Text name for the task. */
                 1000,    /* Stack depth in words. */
                 NULL,    /* This example does not use the task parameter. */
                 1,       /* This task will run at priority 1. */
                 NULL );  /* This example does not use the task handle. */

    /* Create the other task in exactly the same way and at the same priority.*/
    xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );

    /* Start the scheduler so the tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /*
     * If all is well main() will not reach here because the scheduler will now
     * be running the created tasks. If main() does reach here then there was
     * not enough heap memory to create either the idle or timer tasks
     * (described later in this book). Chapter 3 provides more information on

     */
    for( ;; );
}
```

***Listing 4.6*** *Starting the Example 4.1 tasks*

Executing the example produces the output shown in Figure 4.2.


<a name="fig4.2" title="Figure 4.2 The output produced when executing Example 4.1"></a>

```

***Figure 4.2*** *The output produced when executing Example 4.1[^4]*

***

[^4]: The screen shot shows each task printing out its message exactly
once before the next task executes. This is an artificial scenario
that results from using the FreeRTOS Windows simulator. The Windows
simulator is not truly real time. Also, writing to the Windows
console takes a relatively long time and results in a chain of
Windows system calls. Executing the same code on a genuine embedded
target with a fast and non-blocking print function may result in
each task printing its string many times before being switched out
to allow the other task to run.

Figure 4.2 shows the two tasks appearing to execute simultaneously;
however, both tasks execute on the same processor core, so that cannot
be the case. In reality, both tasks are rapidly entering and exiting the
*Running* state. Both tasks are running at the same priority and so share
time on the same processor core. Figure 4.3 shows their actual execution
pattern.

The arrow along the bottom of Figure 4.3 shows time passing from time t1
onwards. The colored lines show which task is executing at each point in
time—for example, Task 1 is executing between times t1 and t2.

Only one task can exist in the *Running* state at any one time. So, as one
task enters the *Running* state (the task is switched in), the other
enters the *Not Running* state (the task is switched out).

Example 4.1 created both tasks from within `main()`, prior to starting the
scheduler. It is also possible to create a task from within another
task. For example, Task 2 could have been created from within Task 1, as
shown by Listing 4.7.


<a name="list4.7" title="Listing 4.7 Creating a task from within another task after the scheduler has started"></a>


```c
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
{
    const char *pcTaskName = "Task 1 is running\r\n";
    volatile unsigned long ul; /* volatile to ensure ul is not optimized away. */

    /*
     * If this task code is executing then the scheduler must already have
     * been started. Create the other task before entering the infinite loop.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( pcTaskName );

        /* Delay for a period. */
        for( ul = 0; ul < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ul++ )
        {
            /*
             * This loop is just a very crude delay implementation. There is
             * nothing to do in here. Later examples will replace this crude
             * loop with a proper delay/sleep function.
             */
        }
    }
}
```

<a name="example4.2" title="Example 4.2 Using the task parameter"></a>
---
***Example 4.2*** *Using the task parameter*

---

The two tasks created in Example 4.1 are almost identical, the only
difference between them is the text string they print out. If you create
two instances of a single task implementation, and use the task
parameter to pass the string into each instance, this would remove the
duplication.

Example 4.2 replaces the two task functions used in Example 4.1 with a
single task function called `vTaskFunction()`, as shown in Listing 4.8.
Note how the task parameter is cast to a `char *` to obtain the string
the task should print out.


<a name="list4.8" title="Listing 4.8 The single task function used to create two tasks in Example 4.2"></a>

```c
void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{

    char *pcTaskName;
    volatile unsigned long ul; /* volatile to ensure ul is not optimized away. */

    /*
     * The string to print out is passed in via the parameter. Cast this to a
     * character pointer.
     */
    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented in an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( pcTaskName );

        /* Delay for a period. */
        for( ul = 0; ul < mainDELAY_LOOP_COUNT; ul++ )
        {
            /*
             * This loop is just a very crude delay implementation. There is
             * nothing to do in here. Later exercises will replace this crude
             * loop with a proper delay/sleep function.
             */
        }
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.8*** *The single task function used to create two tasks in Example 4.2*

Listing 4.9 creates two instances of the task implemented by
`vTaskFunction()`, using the task's parameter to pass a different string
into each. Both tasks execute independently under the control of the
FreeRTOS scheduler and with their own stack, and so with their own copies of
the `pcTaskName` and `ul` variables.

***Listing 4.9*** *The main() function for Example 2*


The output from Example 4.2 is exactly as per that shown for example 1 in Figure
4.2.

## 4.5 Task Priorities

The FreeRTOS scheduler always ensures the highest priority task that can
run is the task selected to enter the *Running* state. Tasks of equal
priority are transitioned into and out of the *Running* state in turn.

The `uxPriority` parameter of the API function used to create the task
gives the task its initial priority. The `vTaskPrioritySet()` API function
changes a task's priority after its creation.

The application-defined `configMAX_PRIORITIES` compile-time configuration
constant sets the number of available priorities. Low numeric priority
values denote low-priority tasks, with priority 0 being the lowest
priority possible—so valid priorities range from 0 to
`(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)`. Any number of tasks can share the same
priority.

The FreeRTOS scheduler has two implementations of the algorithm used to
select the *Running* state task and the maximum allowable value for
`configMAX_PRIORITIES` depends on the implementation used:

### 4.5.1 Generic Scheduler

The generic scheduler is written in C and can be used with all FreeRTOS
architecture ports. It does not impose an upper limit on `configMAX_PRIORITEIS`.
In general, it is advisable to minimize `configMAX_PRIORITIES` because more
values require more RAM and will result in a longer worst-case execution time.

### 4.5.2 Architecture-Optimized Scheduler

Architecture optimized implementations are written in architecture-specific
assembly code and are more performant than the generic c implementation, and the
worst-case execution time is the same for all `configMAX_PRIORITIES` values.

The architecture optimized implementation imposes a maximum value for
`configMAX_PRIORITIES` of 32 on 32-bit architectures and 64 on 64-bit
architectures. As with the generic method, it is advisable to keep
`configMAX_PRIORITIES` at the lowest value practical because higher
values require more RAM.

Set `configUSE_PORT_optimized_TASK_SELECTION` to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h to
use the architecture optimized implementation, or 0 to use the generic
implementation. Not all FreeRTOS ports have an architecture optimized
implementation. Those that do default
`configUSE_PORT_optimized_TASK_SELECTION` to 1 if it is left undefined.
Those that do not, default `configUSE_PORT_optimized_TASK_SELECTION` to 0
if it is left undefined.

## 4.6 Time Measurement and the Tick Interrupt

[Section 4.12, Scheduling Algorithms](#412-scheduling-algorithms), describes an
optional feature called 'time slicing'. Time slicing was used in the examples
presented so far, and is the behavior observed in the output they produced.
In the examples, both tasks were created at the same priority, and both
tasks were always able to run. Therefore, each task executed for a 'time
slice', entering the *Running* state at the start of a time slice, and
exiting the *Running* state at the end of a time slice. In Figure 4.3, the
time between t1 and t2 equals a single time slice.

The scheduler executes at the end of each time slice to select the next
task to run[^5]. A periodic interrupt, called the 'tick interrupt', is
used for this purpose. The `configTICK_RATE_HZ` compile-time configuration
constant sets the frequency of the tick interrupt, and so also the
length of each time slice. For example, setting `configTICK_RATE_HZ` to
100 (Hz) results in each time slice lasting 10 milliseconds. The time
between two tick interrupts is called the 'tick period'—so one time
slice equals one tick period.

[^5]: It is important to note that the end of a time slice is not the
only place that the scheduler can select a new task to run. As we will
demonstrate throughout this book, the scheduler will also select
a new task to run immediately after the currently executing task
enters the *Blocked* state, or when an interrupt moves a higher
priority task into the *Ready* state.

Figure 4.4 expands on Figure 4.3 to also show the execution of the
scheduler. In Figure 4.4, the top line shows when the scheduler is
executing, and the thin arrows show the sequence of execution from a
task to the tick interrupt, then from the tick interrupt back to a
different task.

The optimal value for `configTICK_RATE_HZ` depends on the application,
although a value of 100 is typical.

***Figure 4.4*** *The execution sequence expanded to show the tick interrupt executing*

FreeRTOS API calls specify time in multiples of tick periods, often
referred to simply as 'ticks'. The `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` macro converts a time
specified in milliseconds into a time specified in ticks. The resolution
available depends on the defined tick frequency, and `pdMS_TO_TICKS()`
cannot be used if the tick frequency is above 1KHz (if
`configTICK_RATE_HZ` is greater than 1000). Listing 4.10 shows how to use
`pdMS_TO_TICKS()` to convert a time specified as 200 milliseconds into an
equivalent time specified in ticks.


<a name="list4.10" title="Listing 4.10 Using the pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() macro to convert 200 milliseconds..."></a>

```c
/*
 * pdMS_TO_TICKS() takes a time in milliseconds as its only parameter,
 * and evaluates to the equivalent time in tick periods. This example shows
 * xTimeInTicks being set to the number of tick periods that are equivalent
 * to 200 milliseconds.
 */
TickType_t xTimeInTicks = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 200 );
```

***Listing 4.10*** *Using the pdMS\_TO\_TICKS() macro to convert 200 milliseconds
into an equivalent time in tick periods*

Using `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` to specify times in milliseconds, rather than
directly as ticks, ensures times specified within the application do not
change if the tick frequency is changed.

The 'tick count' is the total number of tick interrupts that have
occurred since the scheduler started, assuming the tick count has not
overflowed. User applications do not have to consider overflows when
specifying delay periods, as FreeRTOS manages time consistency
internally.

[Section 4.12: Scheduling Algorithms](#412-scheduling-algorithms)
describes configuration constants which affect when the scheduler will
select a new task to run and when a tick interrupt will execute.

<a name="example4.3" title="Example 4.3 Experimenting with priorities"></a>
---
***Example 4.3*** *Experimenting with priorities*

---

The scheduler will always ensure the highest priority task that can run
is the task selected to enter the *Running* state. The examples so far
created two tasks at the same priority, so both entered and exited the
*Running* state in turn. This example looks at what happens when the tasks
have different priorities. Listing 4.11 shows the code used to create the
tasks, the first with priority 1, and the second with priority 2. The
single function that implements both tasks has not changed; it still
periodically prints a string, using a null loop to create a delay.


<a name="list4.11" title="Listing 4.11. Creating two tasks at different priorities"></a>


```c
/*
 * Define the strings that will be passed in as the task parameters.
 * These are defined const and not on the stack to ensure they remain valid
 * when the tasks are executing.
 */
static const char * pcTextForTask1 = "Task 1 is running";
static const char * pcTextForTask2 = "Task 2 is running";

int main( void )
{
    /* Create the first task with a priority of 1. */
    xTaskCreate( vTaskFunction,             /* Task Function    */
                 "Task 1",                  /* Task Name        */
                 1000,                      /* Task Stack Depth */
                 ( void * ) pcTextForTask1, /* Task Parameter   */
                 1,                         /* Task Priority    */
                 NULL );

    /* Create the second task at a higher priority of 2. */
    xTaskCreate( vTaskFunction,             /* Task Function    */

                 NULL );

    /* Start the scheduler so the tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /* Will not reach here. */
    return 0;
}
```

***Listing 4.11*** *Creating two tasks at different priorities*

Figure 4.5 shows the output produced by Example 4.3.

The scheduler will always select the highest priority task that can run.
Task 2 has a higher priority than Task 1 and can always run; therefore,
the scheduler always selects Task 2, and Task 1 never executes. Task 1
is said to be 'starved' of processing time by Task 2—it can't print its
string because it is never in the *Running* state.

## 4.7 Expanding the *Not Running* State

So far, the created tasks have always had processing to perform and have
never had to wait for anything—and since they never had to wait for anything,
they were always able to enter the *Running* state. Such 'continuous processing'
tasks have limited usefulness because they can only be created at the very lowest
priority. If they run at any other priority, they will prevent tasks of lower
priority from ever running at all.

To make these tasks useful, they must be re-written to be event-driven. An
event-driven task only has work (processing) to perform after an event
triggers it and cannot enter the *Running* state before that time.
The scheduler always selects the highest priority task that can run. If
a high-priority task cannot be selected because it is waiting for an
event, the scheduler must, instead, select a lower-priority task that
can run. Therefore, writing event-driven tasks means tasks can be
created at different priorities without the highest priority tasks
starving all the lower priority tasks of processing time.

### 4.7.1 The *Blocked* State

A task waiting for an event is said to be in the 'Blocked' state, a
sub-state of the *Not Running* state.

Tasks can enter the *Blocked* state to wait for two different types of
events:

1. Temporal (time-related) events— these events occur either when a delay period
   expires or an absolute time is reached. For example, a task may
   enter the *Blocked* state to wait for 10 milliseconds to pass.

1. Synchronization events— these events originate from another task
   or interrupt. For example, a task may enter the *Blocked* state to
   wait for data to arrive on a queue. Synchronization events cover a
   broad range of event types.

FreeRTOS queues, binary semaphores, counting semaphores, mutexes,
recursive mutexes, event groups, stream buffers, message buffers, and
direct to task notifications can all create synchronization events.
Later chapters cover most of these features.

A task can block on a synchronization event with a timeout, effectively
blocking on both types of event simultaneously. For example, a task may
choose to wait for a maximum of 10 milliseconds for data to arrive on a
queue. The task will leave the *Blocked* state if data arrives within 10
milliseconds or if 10 milliseconds pass without data arriving.

### 4.7.2 The *Suspended* State

*Suspended* is also a sub-state of *Not Running*. Tasks in the Suspended
state are not available to the scheduler. The only way to enter the
Suspended state is through a call to the `vTaskSuspend()` API function,
and the only way out is through a call to the `vTaskResume()` or
`xTaskResumeFromISR()` API functions. Most applications do not use the
Suspended state.

### 4.7.3 The Ready State

Tasks that are in the *Not Running* state and are not *Blocked* or *Suspended*
are said to be in the *Ready* state. They can run, and are therefore 'ready' to
run, but are not currently in the *Running* state.

### 4.7.4 Completing the State Transition Diagram

Figure 4.7 expands on the simplified state diagram to include all of the
*Not Running* sub-states described in this section. The tasks created in the
 examples so far have not used the *Blocked* or *Suspended* states. They have
 only transitioned between the *Ready* state and the *Running* state as shown by
 the bold lines in Figure 4.7.


<a name="fig4.7" title="Figure 4.7 Full task state machine"></a>

***

<a name="example4.4" title="Example 4.4 Using the Blocked state to create a delay"></a>
---
***Example 4.4*** *Using the *Blocked* state to create a delay</i></h3>

---

All the tasks created in the examples presented so far have been
'periodic'—they have delayed for a period and then printed out their string,
before delaying once more, and so on. The delay has been generated very
crudely using a null loop—the task polled an incrementing
loop counter until it reached a fixed value. Example 4.3 clearly
demonstrated the disadvantage of this method. The higher priority task
remained in the *Running* state while it executed the null loop,
'starving' the lower priority task of any processing time.

There are several other disadvantages to any form of polling, not least
of which is its inefficiency. During polling, the task does not really
have any work to do, but it still uses the maximum processing time, and so
wastes processor cycles. Example 4.4 corrects this behavior by replacing
the polling null loop with a call to the `vTaskDelay()` API function, whose
prototype is shown in Listing 4.12. The new task definition is
shown in Listing 4.13. Note that the `vTaskDelay()` API function is
available only when `INCLUDE_vTaskDelay` is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

`vTaskDelay()` places the calling task into the *Blocked* state for a fixed
number of tick interrupts. The task does not use any processing time
while it is in the *Blocked* state, so the task only uses processing time
when there is actually work to be done.


<a name="list4.12" title="Listing 4.12 The vTaskDelay() API function prototype"></a>


```c
void vTaskDelay( TickType_t xTicksToDelay );
```

***Listing 4.12*** *The vTaskDelay() API function prototype*

**vTaskDelay parameters:**

- `xTicksToDelay`

  The number of tick interrupts that the calling task will remain
  in the *Blocked* state before being transitioned back into the Ready
  state.

  For example, if a task called `vTaskDelay( 100 )` when the tick count
  was 10,000, then it would immediately enter the *Blocked* state, and
  remain in the *Blocked* state until the tick count reached 10,100.

  The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` can be used to convert a time specified in
  milliseconds into a time specified in ticks. For example, calling
  `vTaskDelay( pdMS_TO_TICKS( 100 ) )` results in the calling task remaining
  in the *Blocked* state for 100 milliseconds.


<a name="list4.13" title="Listing 4.13 The source code for the example task after replacing the null loop delay with a call..."></a>


```c
void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{
    char * pcTaskName;
    const TickType_t xDelay250ms = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 250 );

    /*
     * The string to print out is passed in via the parameter. Cast this to a
     * character pointer.
     */
    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented in an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( pcTaskName );

        /*
         * Delay for a period. This time a call to vTaskDelay() is used which
         * places the task into the Blocked state until the delay period has
         * expired. The parameter takes a time specified in 'ticks', and the
         * pdMS_TO_TICKS() macro is used (where the xDelay250ms constant is
         * declared) to convert 250 milliseconds into an equivalent time in
         * ticks.
         */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay250ms );
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.13*** *The source code for the example task after replacing the null loop
delay with a call to vTaskDelay()*

Even though the two tasks are still being created at different
priorities, both will now run. The output of Example 4.4, which is shown
in Figure 4.8, confirms the expected behavior.


<a name="fig4.8" title="Figure 4.8 The output produced when Example 4.4 is executed"></a>

```

***Figure 4.8*** *The output produced when Example 4.4 is executed*
***

The execution sequence shown in Figure 4.9 explains why both tasks run,
even though they are created at different priorities. The execution of
the scheduler itself is omitted for simplicity.

The idle task is created automatically when the scheduler is started, to
ensure there is always at least one task that can run (at least one task
in the *Ready* state). [Section 4.8: The Idle Task and the Idle Task Hook](#48-the-idle-task-and-the-idle-task-hook)
describes the Idle task in more detail.


<a name="fig4.9" title="Figure 4.9 The execution sequence when the tasks use vTaskDelay() in place of the null loop"></a>

***
![](media/figure_4.9_vTaskDelay_execution_sequence.png)
***Figure 4.9*** *The execution sequence when the tasks use vTaskDelay() in place of
the null loop*
***

Only the implementation of the two tasks has changed, not their
functionality. Comparing Figure 4.9 with Figure 4.4 demonstrates clearly
that this functionality is being achieved in a much more efficient
manner.

Figure 4.4 shows the execution pattern when the tasks use a null loop to
create a delay and so are always able to run. As a result, they use one
hundred percent of the available processor time between them. Figure 4.9
shows the execution pattern when the tasks enter the *Blocked* state for
the entirety of their delay period. They use processor time only when they
actually have work that needs to be performed (in this case simply a
message to be printed out), and as a result only use a tiny fraction of
the available processing time.

In the scenario shown in Figure 4.9, each time the tasks leave the *Blocked* state
they execute for a fraction of a tick period before re-entering the
Blocked state. Most of the time there are no application tasks that can
run (no application tasks in the *Ready* state) and, therefore, no
application tasks that can be selected to enter the *Running* state. While
this is the case, the idle task runs. The amount of processing time
allocated to the idle is a measure of the spare processing capacity in
the system. Using an RTOS can significantly increase the spare
processing capacity simply by allowing an application to be completely
event driven.

The bold lines in Figure 4.10 show the transitions performed by the tasks
in Example 4.4, with each task now transitioning through the *Blocked* state
before being returned to the *Ready* state.

### 4.7.5 The vTaskDelayUntil() API Function

`vTaskDelayUntil()` is similar to `vTaskDelay()`. As just demonstrated, the
`vTaskDelay()` parameter specifies the number of tick interrupts that
should occur between a task calling `vTaskDelay()`, and the same task once
again transitioning out of the *Blocked* state. The length of time the
task remains in the blocked state is specified by the `vTaskDelay()`
parameter, but the time at which the task leaves the blocked state is
relative to the time at which `vTaskDelay()` was called.

The parameters to `vTaskDelayUntil()` specify, instead, the exact tick
count value at which the calling task should be moved from the Blocked
state into the *Ready* state. `vTaskDelayUntil()` is the API function to use
when a fixed execution period is required (where you want your task to
execute periodically with a fixed frequency), as the time at which the
calling task is unblocked is absolute, rather than relative to when the
function was called (as is the case with `vTaskDelay()`).


<a name="list4.14" title="Listing 4.14 vTaskDelayUntil() API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vTaskDelayUntil( TickType_t * pxPreviousWakeTime,
                      TickType_t xTimeIncrement );
```

***Listing 4.14*** *vTaskDelayUntil() API function prototype*

**vTaskDelayUntil() parameters**

- `pxPreviousWakeTime`

  This parameter is named on the assumption that `vTaskDelayUntil()`
  is being used to implement a task that executes periodically and with a
  fixed frequency. In this case, `pxPreviousWakeTime` holds the time at
  which the task last left the *Blocked* state (was 'woken' up). This time
  is used as a reference point to calculate the time at which the task
  should next leave the *Blocked* state.

  The variable pointed to by `pxPreviousWakeTime` is updated
  automatically in the `vTaskDelayUntil()` function; it would not
  normally be modified by the application code, but must be initialized to
  the current tick count before its first use. Listing 4.15 demonstrates how
  to initialise the variable.

- `xTimeIncrement`

  This parameter is also named on the assumption that
  `vTaskDelayUntil()` is being used to implement a task that executes
  periodically and with a fixed frequency that is set by the
  `xTimeIncrement` value.

  `xTimeIncrement` is specified in 'ticks'. The macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS()` can
  be used to convert a time specified in milliseconds into a time
  specified in ticks.

<a name="example4.5" title="Example 4.5 Converting the example tasks to use vTaskDelayUntil()"></a>
---
***Example 4.5*** *Converting the example tasks to use vTaskDelayUntil()*

---

The two tasks created in Example 4.4 are periodic tasks, but using
`vTaskDelay()` does not guarantee that the frequency at which they run is
fixed, as the time at which the tasks leave the *Blocked* state is
relative to when they call `vTaskDelay()`. Converting the tasks to use
`vTaskDelayUntil()` instead of `vTaskDelay()` solves this potential problem.


<a name="list4.15" title="Listing 4.15 The implementation of the example task using vTaskDelayUntil()"></a>


```c
void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{
    char * pcTaskName;
    TickType_t xLastWakeTime;

    /*
     * The string to print out is passed in via the parameter. Cast this to a
     * character pointer.
     */
    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;

    /*
     * The xLastWakeTime variable needs to be initialized with the current tick
     * count. Note that this is the only time the variable is written to
     * explicitly. After this xLastWakeTime is automatically updated within

     */
    xLastWakeTime = xTaskGetTickCount();

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented in an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( pcTaskName );

        /*
         * This task should execute every 250 milliseconds exactly. As per
         * the vTaskDelay() function, time is measured in ticks, and the

         * xLastWakeTime is automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil(), so
         * is not explicitly updated by the task.
         */
        vTaskDelayUntil( &xLastWakeTime, pdMS_TO_TICKS( 250 ) );
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.15*** *The implementation of the example task using vTaskDelayUntil()*

The output produced by Example 4.5 is exactly as per that shown for Example 4.4
in Figure 4.8.

<a name="example4.6" title="Example 4.6 Combining blocking and non-blocking tasks"></a>
---
***Example 4.6*** *Combining blocking and non-blocking tasks*

---

The previous examples examined the behavior of both polling and blocking
tasks in isolation. This example re-enforces what we have already said regarding
the expected system behavior and demonstrates the execution sequence when the
two schemes are combined, as follows:

1. Two tasks are created at priority 1. These do nothing other than continuously
   print out a string.

   These tasks never make API function calls that could cause them to enter the
   *Blocked* state, so are always in either the Ready or the *Running* state.
   Tasks of this nature are called 'continuous processing' tasks, as they always
   have work to do (albeit rather trivial work, in this case).
   Listing 4.16 shows the source code for the continuous processing tasks.

1. A third task is then created at priority 2, which is above the priority of
   the other two tasks. The third task also just prints out a string, but this
   time periodically, so it uses the `vTaskDelayUntil()` API function to place
   itself into the *Blocked* state between each print iteration.

Listing 4.17 shows the source code of the periodic task.


<a name="list4.16" title="Listing 4.16 The continuous processing task used in Example 4.6"></a>


```c
void vContinuousProcessingTask( void * pvParameters )

    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented in an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /*
         * Print out the name of this task. This task just does this repeatedly
         * without ever blocking or delaying.

        vPrintLine( pcTaskName );
    }

## 4.8 The Idle Task and the Idle Task Hook

The tasks created in Example 4.4 spend most of their time in the Blocked
state. While in this state, they are not able to run, so they cannot be
selected by the scheduler.

There must always be at least one task that can enter the Running
state[^6]. To ensure this is the case, the scheduler automatically
creates an Idle task when `vTaskStartScheduler()` is called. The idle task
does very little more than sit in a loop, so, like the tasks in the first
examples, it is always able to run.

[^6]: This is the case even when the special low power features of
FreeRTOS are being used, in which case the microcontroller on which
FreeRTOS is executing will be placed into a low power mode if none
of the tasks created by the application are able to execute.

The idle task has the lowest possible priority (priority zero), to
ensure it never prevents a higher priority application task from
entering the *Running* state. However, there is nothing to prevent
application designers from creating tasks at, and therefore that share, the idle
task priority, if desired. The `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` compile time
configuration constant in `FreeRTOSConfig.h` can be used to prevent the
Idle task from consuming processing time that would be more productively
allocated to applications tasks that also have a priority of 0. Section
4.12, Scheduling Algorithms, describes `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD`.

Running at the lowest priority ensures the Idle task is transitioned out
of the *Running* state as soon as a higher priority task enters the Ready
state. This can be seen at time **tn** in Figure 4.9, where the Idle task is
immediately swapped out to allow Task 2 to execute at the instant Task 2
leaves the *Blocked* state. Task 2 is said to have preempted the idle
task. Preemption occurs automatically, and without the knowledge of the
task being preempted.

> *Note: If a task uses the `vTaskDelete()` API function to delete itself
> then it is essential that the Idle task is not starved of processing time.
> This is because the Idle task is responsible for cleaning up kernel
> resources used by tasks that deleted themselves.*

### 4.8.1 Idle Task Hook Functions

It is possible to add application specific functionality directly into
the idle task through the use of an idle hook (or idle callback)
function, which is a function that is called automatically by the idle task once
per iteration of the idle task loop.

Common uses for the Idle task hook include:

- Executing low priority, background, or continuous processing
  functionality without the RAM overhead of creating application tasks
  for the purpose.

- Measuring the amount of spare processing capacity. (The idle task
  will run only when all higher priority application tasks have no
  work to perform; so measuring the amount of processing time
  allocated to the idle task provides a clear indication of spare
  processing time.)

- Placing the processor into a low power mode, providing an easy and
  automatic method of saving power whenever there is no application
  processing to be performed (although the achievable power saving is
  less than that achieved by tick-less idle mode).

### 4.8.2 Limitations on the Implementation of Idle Task Hook Functions

Idle task hook functions must adhere to the following rules.

- An Idle task hook function must never attempt to block or suspend itself.

  *Note: Blocking the idle task in any way could cause a scenario where
  no tasks are available to enter the *Running* state.*

- If an application task uses the `vTaskDelete()` API function
  to delete itself, then the Idle task hook must always return to its
  caller within a reasonable time period. This is because the Idle
  task is responsible for cleaning up kernel resources allocated to
  tasks that delete themselves. If the idle task remains permanently
  in the Idle hook function, then this clean-up cannot occur.

Idle task hook functions must have the name and prototype shown in Listing 4.18.


<a name="list4.18" title="Listing 4.18 The idle task hook function name and prototype"></a>

```c
void vApplicationIdleHook( void );
```

***Listing 4.18*** *The idle task hook function name and prototype*

<a name="example4.7" title="Example 4.7 Defining an idle task hook function"></a>
---
***Example 4.7*** *Defining an idle task hook function</i></h3>

---

The use of blocking `vTaskDelay()` API calls in Example 4.4 created a lot of
idle time, that is, time when the Idle task executes because both application
tasks are in the *Blocked* state. Example 4.7 makes use of this idle time
through the addition of an Idle hook function, the source for which is
shown in Listing 4.19.


<a name="list4.19" title="Listing 4.19 A very simple Idle hook function"></a>

```c
/* Declare a variable that will be incremented by the hook function.  */
volatile unsigned long ulIdleCycleCount = 0UL;

/*
 * Idle hook functions MUST be called vApplicationIdleHook(), take no
 * parameters, and return void.
 */
void vApplicationIdleHook( void )
{
    /* This hook function does nothing but increment a counter. */
    ulIdleCycleCount++;
}
```

***Listing 4.19*** *A very simple Idle hook function*


`configUSE_IDLE_HOOK` must be set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h for the idle hook function
to get called.

The function that implements the created tasks is modified slightly to
print out the `ulIdleCycleCount` value, as shown in Listing 4.20.


<a name="list4.20" title="Listing 4.20 The source code for the example task now prints out the ulIdleCycleCount value"></a>


```c
void vTaskFunction( void * pvParameters )
{
    char * pcTaskName;
    const TickType_t xDelay250ms = pdMS_TO_TICKS( 250 );

    /*
     * The string to print out is passed in via the parameter. Cast this to
     * a character pointer.
     */
    pcTaskName = ( char * ) pvParameters;

    /* As per most tasks, this task is implemented in an infinite loop. */
    for( ;; )
    {
        /*
         * Print out the name of this task AND the number of times
         * ulIdleCycleCount has been incremented.
         */
        vPrintLineAndNumber( pcTaskName, ulIdleCycleCount );

        /* Delay for a period of 250 milliseconds. */
        vTaskDelay( xDelay250ms );
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.20*** *The source code for the example task now prints out the
ulIdleCycleCount value*

Figure 4.13 shows the output produced by Example 4.7. It can be seen that
the idle task hook function executes approximately 4 million times
between each iteration of the application tasks (the number of
iterations depends on the hardware speed).

## 4.9 Changing the Priority of a Task

### 4.9.1 The vTaskPrioritySet() API Function

The `vTaskPrioritySet()` API function changes the priority of a task after
the scheduler has been started. The `vTaskPrioritySet()` API function is
only available when `INCLUDE_vTaskPrioritySet` is set to 1 in
FreeRTOSConfig.h.


<a name="list4.21" title="Listing 4.21 The vTaskPrioritySet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vTaskPrioritySet( TaskHandle_t xTask,
                       UBaseType_t uxNewPriority );
```

***Listing 4.21*** *The vTaskPrioritySet() API function prototype*

**vTaskPrioritySet() parameters**

- `pxTask`

  The handle of the task whose priority is being modified (the
  subject task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API
  function, or the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function,
  for information on obtaining handles to tasks.

  A task can change its own priority by passing NULL in place of a
  valid task handle.

- `uxNewPriority`

  The priority to which the subject task is to be set. This is capped
  automatically to the maximum available priority of `(configMAX_PRIORITIES – 1)`,
  where `configMAX_PRIORITIES` is a compile time constant set in the
  FreeRTOSConfig.h header file.


### 4.9.2 The uxTaskPriorityGet() API Function

The `uxTaskPriorityGet()` API function returns the priority of a task. The
`uxTaskPriorityGet()` API function is only available when
`INCLUDE_uxTaskPriorityGet` is set to 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h.


<a name="list4.22" title="Listing 4.22 The uxTaskPriorityGet() API function prototype"></a>

```c
UBaseType_t uxTaskPriorityGet( TaskHandle_t xTask );
```

***Listing 4.22*** *The uxTaskPriorityGet() API function prototype*

**uxTaskPriorityGet() parameters and return value**

- `pxTask`

  The handle of the task whose priority is being queried (the
  subject task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API
  function, or the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function,
  for information on how to obtain handles to tasks.

  A task can query its own priority by passing NULL in place of a valid
  task handle.

- Return value

  The priority currently assigned to the task being queried.


<a name="example4.8" title="Example 4.8 Changing task priorities"></a>
---
***Example 4.8*** *Changing task priorities*

---

The scheduler always selects the highest *Ready* state task as the task to
enter the *Running* state. Example 4.8 demonstrates this by using the
`vTaskPrioritySet()` API function to change the priority of two tasks
relative to each other.

Example 4.8 creates two tasks at two different priorities. Neither task
makes any API function calls that could cause it to enter the Blocked
state, so both are always in either the *Ready* state or the Running
state. Therefore, the task with the highest relative priority will
always be the task selected by the scheduler to be in the *Running* state.

Example 4.8 behaves as follows:

1. Task 1 (Listing 4.23) is created with the highest priority, so it is
   guaranteed to run first. Task 1 prints out a couple of strings
   before raising the priority of Task 2 (Listing 4.24) above its own
   priority.

1. Task 2 starts to run (enters the *Running* state) as soon as it has
   the highest relative priority. Only one task can be in the Running
   state at any one time, so when Task 2 is in the *Running* state, Task
   1 is in the *Ready* state.

1. Task 2 prints out a message before setting its own priority back
   down to below that of Task 1.

1. When Task 2 sets its priority back down, then Task 1 is once again the
   highest priority task, so Task 1 re-enters the *Running* state,
   forcing Task 2 back into the *Ready* state.


<a name="list4.23" title="Listing 4.23 The implementation of Task 1 in Example 4.8"></a>

```c
void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
{
    UBaseType_t uxPriority;

    /*
     * This task will always run before Task 2 as it is created with the higher
     * priority. Neither Task 1 nor Task 2 ever block so both will always be in
     * either the Running or the Ready state.
     */

    /*
     * Query the priority at which this task is running - passing in NULL means
     * "return the calling task's priority".
     */
    uxPriority = uxTaskPriorityGet( NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 1 is running" );

        /*
         * Setting the Task 2 priority above the Task 1 priority will cause
         * Task 2 to immediately start running (as then Task 2 will have the
         * higher priority of the two created tasks). Note the use of the
         * handle to task 2 (xTask2Handle) in the call to vTaskPrioritySet().
         * Listing 4.25 shows how the handle was obtained.
         */
        vPrintLine( "About to raise the Task 2 priority" );
        vTaskPrioritySet( xTask2Handle, ( uxPriority + 1 ) );

        /*
         * Task 1 will only run when it has a priority higher than Task 2.
         * Therefore, for this task to reach this point, Task 2 must already
         * have executed and set its priority back down to below the priority
         * of this task.
         */
    }
}
```

     *
     * Query the priority at which this task is running - passing in NULL means
     * "return the calling task's priority".
     */
    uxPriority = uxTaskPriorityGet( NULL );

    for( ;; )
    {
        /*
         * For this task to reach this point Task 1 must have already run and

         /* Print out the name of this task. */
        vPrintLine( "Task 2 is running" );

        /*
         * Set the priority of this task back down to its original value.
         * Passing in NULL as the task handle means "change the priority of the
         * calling task". Setting the priority below that of Task 1 will cause
         * Task 1 to immediately start running again – preempting this task.
         */
        vPrintLine( "About to lower the Task 2 priority" );
        vTaskPrioritySet( NULL, ( uxPriority - 2 ) );
    }
}
```

***Listing 4.24*** *The implementation of Task 2 in Example 4.8*

Each task can both query and set its own priority by using NULL in place
of a valid task handle. A task handle is only required when a task
wishes to reference a task other than itself, such as when Task 1
changes the priority of Task 2. To allow Task 1 to do this, the Task 2
handle is obtained and saved when Task 2 is created, as highlighted in
the comments in Listing 4.25.


<a name="list4.25" title="Listing 4.25 The implementation of main() for Example 4.8"></a>

```c
/* Declare a variable that is used to hold the handle of Task 2. */
TaskHandle_t xTask2Handle = NULL;

int main( void )
{
    /*
     * Create the first task at priority 2. The task parameter is not used
     * and set to NULL. The task handle is also not used so is also set to
     * NULL.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask1, "Task 1", 1000, NULL, 2, NULL );
    /* The task is created at priority 2 ______^. */

    /*
     * Create the second task at priority 1 - which is lower than the priority
     * given to Task 1. Again the task parameter is not used so is set to NULL-
     * BUT this time the task handle is required so the address of xTask2Handle
     * is passed in the last parameter.
     */
    xTaskCreate( vTask2, "Task 2", 1000, NULL, 1, &xTask2Handle );
    /* The task handle is the last parameter _____^^^^^^^^^^^^^ */

    /* Start the scheduler so the tasks start executing. */
    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /*
     * If all is well main() will not reach here because the scheduler will
     * now be running the created tasks. If main() does reach here then there
     * was not enough heap memory to create either the idle or timer tasks

     */
    for( ;; )
    {
    }
}
```

## 4.10 Deleting a Task

### 4.10.1 The vTaskDelete() API Function

The `vTaskDelete()` API function deletes a task. The `vTaskDelete()` API
function is only available when `INCLUDE_vTaskDelete` is set to 1 in
FreeRTOSConfig.h.

It is not good practice to continuously create and delete tasks at run
time, so consider other design options, such as re-using tasks, if you
find yourself needing this function.

Deleted tasks no longer exist and cannot enter the *Running* state again.

If a task that was created using dynamic memory allocation later deletes itself,
the Idle task is responsible for freeing the memory allocated for use, such as
the deleted task's data structure and stack. So it is important that
applications do not completely starve the Idle task of all processing
time when this is the case.

> *Note: Only memory allocated to a task by the kernel itself is freed
> automatically when the task is deleted. Any memory or other resource
> that was allocated during the implementation of the task must be freed explicitly
> if it is no longer needed.*


<a name="list4.26" title="Listing 4.26 The vTaskDelete() API function prototype"></a>


```c
void vTaskDelete( TaskHandle_t xTaskToDelete );
```

***Listing 4.26*** *The vTaskDelete() API function prototype*

**vTaskDelete() parameters**

- `pxTaskToDelete`

  The handle of the task that is to be deleted (the subject
  task). See the `pxCreatedTask` parameter of the `xTaskCreate()` API function,
  and the return value of the `xTaskCreateStatic()` API function, for
  information on obtaining handles to tasks.

  A task can delete itself by passing NULL in place of a valid task
  handle.


<a name="example4.9" title="Example 4.9 Deleting tasks"></a>
---
***Example 4.9*** *Deleting tasks*

---

This is a very simple example that behaves as follows.

1. Task 1 is created by `main()` with priority 1. When it runs, it
   creates Task 2 at priority 2. Task 2 is now the highest priority
   task, so it starts to execute immediately. Listing 4.27 shows the
   source code for `main()`. Listing 4.28 shows the source code for Task 1.

1. Task 2 does nothing other than delete itself. It could delete itself
   by passing NULL to `vTaskDelete()` but instead, for demonstration
   purposes, it uses its own task handle. Listing 4.29 shows the source
   code for Task 2.

1. When Task 2 has been deleted, Task 1 is again the highest priority
   task, so it continues executing—at which point it calls `vTaskDelay()` to
   block for a short period.

1. The Idle task executes while Task 1 is in the blocked state and
   frees the memory that was allocated to the now deleted Task 2.

1. When Task 1 leaves the blocked state it again becomes the highest
   priority *Ready* state task and so preempts the Idle task. When it
   enters the *Running* state it creates Task 2 again, and so it goes on.

```c
int main( void )
{
    /* Create the first task at priority 1. */

    vTaskStartScheduler();

    /* main() should never reach here as the scheduler has been started. */

## 4.11 Thread Local Storage and Reentrancy

Thread Local Storage allows an application developer to store arbitrary data in
the Task Control Block of each task. This feature is most commonly used to store
data which would normally be stored in a global variable by non-reentrant functions.

A reentrant function is a function which can safely run from multiple threads
without any side effects. When non-reentrant functions are used in a
multi-threaded environment without thread local storage, special care must be
taken to check the out of band results of these function calls from within a
critical section. Excessive use of critical sections degrades RTOS performance,
so Thread Local Storage is often preferred over the use of critical sections.

By far the most common use of Thread Local Storage is the ```errno``` global used
in the ISO C standard used by the C standard library and POSIX systems.
The ```errno``` global is used to provide an extended result or error code for
common standard library functions such as strtof and strtol.

### 4.11.1 C Runtime Thread Local Storage Implementations

Most embedded libc implementations provide APIs to ensure that non-reentrant
functions can work correctly in a multi-threaded environment. FreeRTOS includes
support for the reentrancy APIs of two commonly used open-source libraries:
[newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/) and
[picolibc](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc).
These pre-built C Runtime Thread Local Storage implementations can be enabled by
by defining the respective macro listed below in their project's FreeRTOSConfig.h
file.

- ```configUSE_NEWLIB_REENTRANT``` for [newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/)
- ```configUSE_PICOLIBC_TLS``` for [picolibc](https://github.com/picolibc/picolibc)

### 4.11.2 Custom C Runtime Thread Local Storage

Application developers may implement thread local storage by defining the following
macros in their FreeRTOSConfig.h file:

- Define ```configUSE_C_RUNTIME_TLS_SUPPORT``` to 1 to enable C Runtime Thread
Local Storage support.

- Define ```configTLS_BLOCK_TYPE``` to the c type which should be used for storing
C Runtime Thread Local Storage data.

- Define ```configINIT_TLS_BLOCK``` to the c code which should be run when initializing
the C Runtime Thread Local Storage block.

- Define ```configSET_TLS_BLOCK``` to the c code which should be run when switching
in a new task

- Define ```configDEINIT_TLS_BLOCK``` to the c code which should be run when de-initializing
the C Runtime Thread Local Storage block.

### 4.11.3 Application Thread Local Storage

In addition to C Runtime Thread Local Storage, application developers may also
define a set of application specific pointers to be included in the task control
block. This feature is enabled by setting ```configNUM_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE_POINTERS```
to a non-zero number in the project's FreeRTOSConfig.h file.
The ```vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer``` and ```pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer```
functions defined in Listing 4.30 may be used respectively to set and get the
value of each thread local storage pointer at runtime.


<a name="list4.30" title="Listing 4.30 Function prototypes of the Thread Local Storage Pointer API functions"></a>

```c
void * pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer( TaskHandle_t xTaskToQuery,
                                           BaseType_t xIndex )

void vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer( TaskHandle_t xTaskToSet,
                                        BaseType_t xIndex,
                                        void * pvValue );
```

## 4.12 Scheduling Algorithms

### 4.12.1 A Recap of Task States and Events

The task that is actually running (using processing time) is in the
*Running* state. On a single core processor there can only be one task in
the *Running* state at any given time. It is also possible to run FreeRTOS
on more than one core (asymmetric multiprocessing, or AMP), or have
FreeRTOS schedule tasks across multiple cores (symmetric
multiprocessing, or SMP). Neither of those scenarios are described here.

Tasks that are not actually running, but are not in either the Blocked
state or the *Suspended* state, are in the *Ready* state. Tasks in the Ready
state are available to be selected by the scheduler as the task to enter
the *Running* state. The scheduler will always choose the highest priority
Ready state task to enter the *Running* state.

Tasks can wait in the *Blocked* state for an event and they are automatically
moved back to the *Ready* state when the event occurs. Temporal events
occur at a particular time, for example, when a block time expires, and
are normally used to implement periodic or timeout behavior.
Synchronization events occur when a task or interrupt service routine
sends information using a task notification, queue, event group, message
buffer, stream buffer, or one of the many types of semaphore. They are
generally used to signal asynchronous activity, such as data arriving at
a peripheral.


### 4.12.2 Selecting the Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduling algorithm is the software routine that decides which
*Ready* state task to transition into the *Running* state.

All the examples so far have used the same scheduling algorithm, but the
algorithm can be changed using the `configUSE_PREEMPTION` and
`configUSE_TIME_SLICING` configuration constants. Both constants are
defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.

A third configuration constant, `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE`, also affects
the scheduling algorithm, as its use can result in the tick interrupt
being turned off completely for extended periods.
`configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE` is an advanced option provided specifically for
use in applications that must minimize their power consumption.
The descriptions provided in this section assume `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE`
is set to 0, which is the default setting if the constant is left
undefined.

In all possible single core configurations the FreeRTOS scheduler
selects tasks that share a priority in turn. This 'take it in turn'
policy is often referred to as 'Round Robin Scheduling'. A Round Robin
scheduling algorithm does not guarantee time is shared equally between
tasks of equal priority, only that *Ready* state tasks of equal priority
enter the *Running* state in turn.

### 4.12.3 Prioritized Preemptive Scheduling with Time Slicing

The configuration shown in the Table 5 sets the FreeRTOS scheduler to use a
scheduling algorithm called 'Fixed Priority Preemptive Scheduling with
Time Slicing', which is the scheduling algorithm used by most small RTOS
applications, and the algorithm used by all the examples presented in
this book so far. The next table provides a description of the terminology
used in the algorithm's name.

**An explanation of the terms used to describe the scheduling policy:**

- Fixed Priority

  Scheduling algorithms described as 'Fixed Priority' do not change the priority
  assigned to the tasks being scheduled, but also do not prevent the tasks
  themselves from changing their own priority or that of other tasks.

- Preemptive

  Preemptive scheduling algorithms will immediately 'preempt' the *Running* state
  task if a task that has a priority higher than the *Running* state task enters
  the *Ready* state. Being preempted means being involuntarily moved out of the
  *Running* state and into the *Ready* state (without explicitly yielding or
  blocking) to allow a different task to enter the *Running* state. Task preemption
  can occur at any time, not just in the RTOS tick interrupt.

- Time Slicing

  Time slicing is used to share processing time between tasks of equal priority,
  even when the tasks do not explicitly yield or enter the *Blocked* state.
  Scheduling algorithms described as using *Time Slicing* select a new task to
  enter the *Running* state at the end of each time slice if there are other *Ready*
  state tasks that have the same priority as the Running task. A time slice is equal
  to the time between two RTOS tick interrupts.

Figure 4.18 and Figure 4.19 demonstrate how tasks are scheduled when a fixed
priority preemptive scheduling with time slicing algorithm is used.
Figure 4.18 shows the sequence in which tasks are selected to enter the
*Running* state when all the tasks in an application have a unique
priority. Figure 4.19 shows the sequence in which tasks are selected to
enter the *Running* state when two tasks in an application share a
priority.

***Figure 4.18*** *Execution pattern highlighting task prioritization and preemption
in a hypothetical application in which each task has been assigned a unique
priority*
***

Referring to Figure 4.18:

- Idle Task

  The idle task is running at the lowest priority, so it gets preempted
  every time a higher priority task enters the *Ready* state, for example, at
  times t3, t5 and t9.

- Task 3

  Task 3 is an event-driven task that executes with a relatively low
  priority, but above the Idle priority. It spends most of its time in the
  *Blocked* state waiting for its event of interest, transitioning from the
  *Blocked* state to the *Ready* state each time the event occurs. All
  FreeRTOS inter-task communication mechanisms (task notifications,
  queues, semaphores, event groups, etc.) can be used to signal events and
  unblock tasks in this way.

  Events occur at times t3 and t5, and also somewhere between t9 and t12.
  The events occurring at times t3 and t5 are processed immediately because, at
  these times, Task 3 is the highest priority task that is able to run.
  The event that occurs somewhere between times t9 and t12 is not
  processed until t12 because, until then, the higher priority tasks Task
  1 and Task 2 are still executing. It is only at time t12 that both Task
  1 and Task 2 are in the *Blocked* state, making Task 3 the highest
  priority *Ready* state task.

- Task 2

  Task 2 is a periodic task that executes at a priority above the priority
  of Task 3, but below the priority of Task 1. The task's period interval
  means Task 2 wants to execute at times t1, t6, and t9.

  At time t6, Task 3 is in the *Running* state, but Task 2 has the higher
  relative priority so preempts Task 3 and starts executing immediately.
  Task 2 completes its processing and re-enters the *Blocked* state at time
  t7, at which point Task 3 can re-enter the *Running* state to complete its
  processing. Task 3 itself Blocks at time t8.

- Task 1

  Task 1 is also an event-driven task. It executes with the highest
  priority of all, so can preempt any other task in the system. The only
  Task 1 event shown occurs at time t10, at which time Task 1 preempts
  Task 2. Task 2 can complete its processing only after Task 1 has
  re-entered the *Blocked* state at time t11.


<a name="fig4.19" title="Figure 4.19 Execution pattern highlighting task prioritization and time slicing..."></a>

***
![](media/figure_4.19_time_slicing_execution_pattern.png)
***Figure 4.19*** *Execution pattern highlighting task prioritization and time slicing
in a hypothetical application in which two tasks run at the same priority*
***

Referring to Figure 4.19:

- The Idle Task and Task 2

  The Idle task and Task 2 are both continuous processing tasks, and both
  have a priority of 0 (the lowest possible priority). The scheduler only
  allocates processing time to the priority 0 tasks when there are no
  higher priority tasks that are able to run, and shares the time that is
  allocated to the priority 0 tasks by time slicing. A new time slice
  starts on each tick interrupt, which in Figure 4.19 occurs at times t1, t2,
  t3, t4, t5, t8, t9, t10 and t11.

  The Idle task and Task 2 enter the *Running* state in turn, which can
  result in both tasks being in the *Running* state for part of the same
  time slice, as happens between time t5 and time t8.

- Task 1

  The priority of Task 1 is higher than the Idle priority. Task 1 is an
  event driven task that spends most of its time in the *Blocked* state
  waiting for its event of interest, transitioning from the *Blocked* state
  to the *Ready* state each time the event occurs.

  The event of interest occurs at time t6. At t6 Task 1 becomes the
  highest priority task that is able to run, and therefore Task 1
  preempts the Idle task part way through a time slice. Processing of the
  event completes at time t7, at which point Task 1 re-enters the Blocked
  state.

Figure 4.19 shows the Idle task sharing processing time with a task
created by the application writer. Allocating that much processing time
to the Idle task might not be desirable if the Idle priority tasks
created by the application writer have work to do, but the Idle task
does not. The `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` compile time configuration
constant can be used to change how the Idle task is scheduled:

- If `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 0 then the Idle task remains in
  the *Running* state for the entirety of its time slice, unless it is
  preempted by a higher priority task.

- If `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 1 then the Idle task yields
  (voluntarily gives up whatever remains of its allocated time slice)
  on each iteration of its loop if there are other Idle priority tasks
  in the *Ready* state.

The execution pattern shown in Figure 4.19 is what would be observed when
`configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 0. The execution pattern shown in
Figure 4.20 is what would be observed in the same scenario when
`configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 1.


<a name="fig4.20" title="Figure 4.20 The execution pattern for the same scenario as shown in Figure 4.19..."></a>

![](media/figure_4.20_time_slicing_with_yield_execution_pattern.png)
***Figure 4.20*** *The execution pattern for the same scenario as shown in Figure 4.19,
but this time with `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` set to 1*
***

Figure 4.20 also shows that when `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 1, the
task selected to enter the *Running* state after the Idle task does not
execute for an entire time slice, but instead executes for whatever
remains of the time slice during which the Idle task yielded.

### 4.12.4 Prioritized Preemptive Scheduling without Time Slicing

Prioritized Preemptive Scheduling without time slicing maintains the
same task selection and preemption algorithms as described in the
previous section, but does not use time slicing to share processing time
between tasks of equal priority.

The Table 5 shows the FreeRTOSConfig.h settings that configure the FreeRTOS
scheduler to use prioritized preemptive scheduling without time slicing.

As was demonstrated in Figure 4.19, if time slicing is used, and there is
more than one ready state task at the highest priority that is able to
run, then the scheduler selects a new task to enter the *Running* state
during each RTOS tick interrupt (a tick interrupt marking the end of a
time slice). If time slicing is not used, then the scheduler only
selects a new task to enter the *Running* state when either:

- A higher priority task enters the *Ready* state.

- The task in the *Running* state enters the *Blocked* or *Suspended* state.

There are fewer task context switches when time slicing is not used than
when time slicing is used. Therefore, turning time slicing off results
in a reduction in the scheduler's processing overhead. However, turning
time slicing off can also result in tasks of equal priority receiving
greatly different amounts of processing time, a scenario demonstrated by
Figure 4.21. For this reason, running the scheduler without time slicing
is considered an advanced technique that should only be used by
experienced users.


<a name="fig4.21" title="Figure 4.21 Execution pattern that demonstrates how tasks of equal priority can..."></a>

***
![](media/figure_4.21_equal_priority_without_time_slicing_execution_pattern.png)
***Figure 4.21*** *Execution pattern that demonstrates how tasks of equal priority can
receive hugely different amounts of processing time when time slicing is not used*
***

Referring to Figure 4.21, which assumes `configIDLE_SHOULD_YIELD` is set to 0:

- Tick Interrupts

  Tick interrupts occur at times t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t8, t11, t12 and
  t13.

- Task 1

  Task 1 is a high priority event driven task that spends most of its
  time in the *Blocked* state waiting for its event of interest. Task 1
  transitions from the *Blocked* state to the *Ready* state (and
  subsequently, as it is the highest priority *Ready* state task, on into
  the *Running* state) each time the event occurs. Figure 4.21 shows Task 1
  processing an event between times t6 and t7, then again between times
  t9 and t10.

- The Idle Task and Task 2

  The Idle task and Task 2 are both continuous processing tasks, and both
  have a priority of 0 (the idle priority). Continuous processing tasks do
  not enter the *Blocked* state.

  Time slicing is not being used, so an idle priority task that is in the
  *Running* state will remain in the *Running* state until it is preempted by
  the higher priority Task 1.

  In Figure 4.21 the Idle task starts running at time t1, and remains in the
  *Running* state until it is preempted by Task 1 at time t6, which is more
  than four complete tick periods after it entered the *Running* state.

  Task 2 starts running at time t7, which is when Task 1 re-enters the
  *Blocked* state to wait for another event. Task 2 remains in the Running
  state until it too is preempted by Task 1 at time t9, which is less than
  one tick period after it entered the *Running* state.

  At time t10 the Idle task re-enters the *Running* state, despite having
  already received more than four times more processing time than Task 2.

### 4.12.5 Cooperative Scheduling

This book focuses on preemptive scheduling, but FreeRTOS can also use
cooperative scheduling. The Table 5 shows the FreeRTOSConfig.h settings
that configure the FreeRTOS scheduler to use cooperative scheduling.

When using the cooperative scheduler (and therefore assuming
application-provided interrupt service routines do not explicitly
request context switches) a context switch only occurs when the Running
state task enters the *Blocked* state, or the *Running* state task explicitly
yields (manually requests a re-schedule) by calling `taskYIELD()`. Tasks
are never preempted, so time slicing cannot be used.

Figure 4.22 demonstrates the behavior of the cooperative scheduler. The
horizontal dashed lines in Figure 4.22 show when a task is in the Ready
state.


<a name="fig4.22" title="Figure 4.22 Execution pattern demonstrating the behavior of the cooperative scheduler"></a>

***
![](media/figure_4.22_cooperative_scheduler_execution_pattern.png)
***Figure 4.22*** *Execution pattern demonstrating the behavior of the cooperative scheduler*
***

Referring to Figure 4.22:

- Task 1

  Task 1 has the highest priority. It starts in the *Blocked* state,
  waiting for a semaphore.

  At time t3, an interrupt gives the semaphore, causing Task 1 to leave
  the *Blocked* state and enter the *Ready* state (giving semaphores from
  interrupts is covered in Chapter 6).

  At time t3, Task 1 is the highest priority *Ready* state task, and if the
  preemptive scheduler had been used Task 1 would become the Running
  state task. However, as the cooperative scheduler is being used, Task
  1 remains in the *Ready* state until time t4, which is when the Running
  state task calls `taskYIELD()`.

- Task 2

  The priority of Task 2 is between that of Task 1 and Task 3. It starts
  in the *Blocked* state, waiting for a message that is sent to it by Task
  3 at time t2.

  At time t2, Task 2 is the highest priority *Ready* state task, and if the
  preemptive scheduler had been used Task 2 would become the Running
  state task. However, as the cooperative scheduler is being used, Task
  2 remains in the *Ready* state until the *Running* state task either
  enters the *Blocked* state or calls `taskYIELD()`.

  The *Running* state task calls `taskYIELD()` at time t4, but by then Task
  1 is the highest priority *Ready* state task, so Task 2 does not
  actually become the *Running* state task until Task 1 re-enters the
  *Blocked* state at time t5.

  At time t6, Task 2 re-enters the *Blocked* state to wait for the next
  message, at which point Task 3 is once again the highest priority
  *Ready* state task.

In a multi-tasking application the application writer must take care
that a resource is not accessed by more than one task simultaneously, as
simultaneous access could corrupt the resource. As an example, consider
the following scenario in which the accessed resource is a UART (serial
port). Two tasks write strings to the UART; Task 1 writes
"abcdefghijklmnop", and Task 2 writes "123456789":

1. Task 1 is in the *Running* state and starts to write its string. It
   writes "abcdefg" to the UART, but leaves the *Running* state before
   writing any further characters.

1. Task 2 enters the *Running* state and writes "123456789" to the UART,
   before leaving the *Running* state.

1. Task 1 re-enters the *Running* state and writes the remaining
   characters of its string to the UART.

In that scenario, what is actually written to the UART is
"abcdefg123456789hijklmnop". The string written by Task 1 has not been
written to the UART in an unbroken sequence as intended, but instead it
has been corrupted, because the string written to the UART by Task 2
appears within it.

Using the cooperative scheduler normally makes it easier to avoid
problems caused by simultaneous access than when using the preemptive
scheduler[^7]:

[^7]: Methods of safely sharing resources between tasks are covered
later in this book. Resources provided by FreeRTOS itself, such as
queues and semaphores, are always safe to share between tasks.

- When you use the preemptive scheduler the *Running* state task can be
  preempted at any time, including when a resource it is sharing with
  another task is in an inconsistent state. As just demonstrated by
  the UART example, leaving a resource in an inconsistent state can
  result in data corruption.

- When you use the cooperative scheduler you control when a switch to
  another task occurs. You can, therefore, ensure a switch to another
  task does not occur while a resource is in an inconsistent state.

- In the above UART example, you can ensure Task 1 does not leave the
  *Running* state until after writing its entire string to the UART
  and, in doing so, remove the possibility of the string being corrupted by the
  activities of another task.

As demonstrated in Figure 4.22, using the cooperative scheduler makes
systems less responsive than when using the preemptive scheduler:

- When using the preemptive scheduler, the scheduler starts running a
  task immediately when the task becomes the highest priority *Ready*
  state task. This is often essential in real-time systems which must
  respond to high priority events within a defined time period.

- When using the cooperative scheduler, a switch to a task that has
  become the highest priority *Ready* state task is not performed until
  the *Running* state task enters the *Blocked* state or calls
  `taskYIELD()`.
