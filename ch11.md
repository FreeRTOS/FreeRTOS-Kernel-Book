# 11 Low Power Support

## 11.1 Power Saving Introduction

FreeRTOS offers an easy way to tap into low power modes with the IDLE task 
hooks and tickless Idle mode.

It is common to reduce the power consumed by the microcontroller on which FreeRTOS is running by using 
the IDLE task hook to place the microcontroller into a low power state. The power saving that can be 
achieved by this method is limited by the necessity to periodically exit and then re-enter the low power 
state to process tick interrupts. Further, if the frequency of the tick interrupt is too high (wake from 
idle is too frequent), the energy and time consumed entering and then exiting a low power state for every 
tick will outweigh any potential power saving gains for all but the lightest power saving modes.
 
FreeRTOS supports a low power state that allows the microcontroller to periodically enter and exit low 
power consumption. The FreeRTOS tickless idle mode stops the periodic tick interrupt during idle periods 
(when there are no application tasks that are able to execute), which allows the MCU to remain in a deep 
power saving state until either an interrupt occurs, or it is time for the RTOS kernel to transition a 
task into the Ready state. It then makes a correcting adjustment to the RTOS tick count value when the 
tick interrupt is restarted. The principle of the FreeRTOS tickless mode is to make the MCU enter the 
low-power mode to save system power consumption when the MCU is performing the idle task.


## 11.2 FreeRTOS Sleep Modes

There are three types of sleep modes supported in FreeRTOS: 

1. eAbortSleep - This mode denotes a task has been made ready , a context switch was pended or a tick 
   interrupt has already occurred but was pended since the scheduler was suspended. It signals the RTOS 
   to abort entering a sleep mode.

2. eStandardSleep - This mode allows to enter a sleep mode that will not last longer than the expected 
   idle time.

3. eNoTasksWaitingTimeout - This mode is entered when no tasks are waiting for a timeout so it is safe to 
   enter a sleep mode that can only be exited by an external interrupt or reset.
  
  
## 11.3 Functions and Enabling Built-in Tickless Idle Functionality

The Built-in Tickless Idle functionality is enabled by defining `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE` as 1 in FreeRTOSConfig.h 
(for ports that support this feature). User defined tickless idle functionality can be provided for any 
FreeRTOS port (including those that include a built in implementation) by defining `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE` 
to 2 in FreeRTOSConfig.h. 

When the tickless idle functionality is enabled, the kernel will call the `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
macro when the following two conditions are satisfied:

1. The Idle task is the only task able to run because all the application tasks are either in the Blocked 
   state or in the Suspended state.

2. At least n further complete tick periods will pass before the kernel is due to transition an application 
   task out of the Blocked state, where n is set by the `configEXPECTED_IDLE_TIME_BEFORE_SLEEP` definition 
   in FreeRTOSConfig.h.


### 11.3.1 The portSUPPRESS\_TICKS\_AND\_SLEEP() Macro

<a name="list11.1" title="Listing 11.1 The prototype for the portSUPPRESS\_TICKS\_AND\_SLEEP macro"></a>

```c
portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP( xExpectedIdleTime )
```
***Listing 11.1*** *The prototype for the portSUPPRESS\_TICKS\_AND\_SLEEP macro*

The value of the `xExpectedIdleTime` parameter in `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` equals the total number 
of tick periods before a task is due to be moved into the Ready state. The parameter value is therefore the 
time the microcontroller can safely remain in a deep sleep state, with the tick interrupt suppressed. 


### 11.3.2 The vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep Function

The `vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep()` function is defined in FreeRTOS and it can be used to implement the 
tickless mode. This function is weakly defined in the FreeRTOS Cortex-M port layer and can be overridden 
by the application writer.

<a name="list11.2" title="Listing 11.2 The vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep( TickType_t xExpectedIdleTime );
```
***Listing 11.2*** *The vPortSuppressTicksAndSleep API function prototype*


### 11.3.3 The eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus Function

The API *eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus* returns the sleep mode status to determine if it is ok to proceed 
with the sleep and if it is ok to sleep indefinitely. This functionality is only available when `configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE` 
is set to 1.

<a name="list11.3" title="Listing 11.3 The eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus API function prototype"></a>
 
```c
eSleepModeStatus eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus( void );
```
***Listing 11.3*** *The eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus API function prototype*


If `eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus()` returns `eNoTasksWaitingTimeout` when it is called from 
within `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()`, then the microcontroller can remain in a deep sleep state 
indefinitely. `eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus()` will only return `eNoTasksWaitingTimeout` when the 
following conditions are true:

+ Software timers are not being used, so the scheduler is not due to execute a timer callback function 
  at any time in the future.

+ All the application tasks are either in the Suspended state, or in the Blocked state with a timeout value 
  of `portMAX_DELAY`, so the scheduler is not due to transition a task out of the Blocked state at any fixed 
  time in the future.

To avoid race conditions, the FreeRTOS scheduler is suspended before `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` is 
called, and resumed when `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` completes. This ensures application tasks cannot 
execute between the microcontroller exiting its low power state and `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
completing its execution. Further, it is necessary for the `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` function to 
create a small critical section between the timer being stopped and the sleep mode being entered to ensure 
it is ok to proceed into the sleep mode. `eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus()` should be called from this critical 
section.

In addition, FreeRTOS provides users with two other interface functions defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h. These 
macros allow the application writer to add additional steps before and after the MCU is placed into the low 
power state, respectively.


### 11.3.4 The configPRE\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING configuration

<a name="list11.4" title="Listing 11.4 The prototype for the configPRE\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING macro"></a>

```c
configPRE_SLEEP_PROCESSING( xExpectedIdleTime )
```
***Listing 11.4*** *The prototype for the configPRE\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING macro*


Before the user can make the MCU enter the low-power mode, `configPRE_SLEEP_PROCESSING()` must be called to 
configure the system parameters to reduce the system power consumption, such as turning off other peripheral 
clocks, reducing the system frequency. 


### 11.3.5 The configPOST\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING configuration

<a name="list11.5" title="Listing 11.5 The prototype for the configPOST\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING macro"></a>

```c
configPOST_SLEEP_PROCESSING( xExpectedIdleTime )
```
***Listing 11.5*** *The prototype for the configPOST\_SLEEP\_PROCESSING macro*


After exiting the low-power mode, the user should call the `configPOST_SLEEP_PROCESSING()` function 
to restore the system's main frequency and peripheral functions.


## 11.4 Implementing portSUPPRESS\_TICKS\_AND\_SLEEP() Macro

If the FreeRTOS port in use does not provide a default implementation of `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()`, 
then the application writer can provide their own implementation by defining `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
in FreeRTOSConfig.h. If the FreeRTOS port in use does provide a default implementation of `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()`, 
then the application writer can override the default implementation by defining `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` 
in FreeRTOSConfig.h. 

The following source code is an example of how `portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP()` might be implemented by an 
application writer. The example is basic, and will introduce some slippage between the time maintained by 
the kernel and calendar time. Of the function calls shown in the example, only `vTaskStepTick()` 
and `eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus()` are part of the FreeRTOS API. The other functions are specific to the 
clocks and power saving modes available on the hardware in use, and as such, must be provided by the 
application writer.

```c
/* First define the portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP() macro.  The parameter is the
   time, in ticks, until the kernel next needs to execute. */

/* Define the function that is called by portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP(). */
void vApplicationSleep( TickType_t xExpectedIdleTime )

    unsigned long ulLowPowerTimeBeforeSleep, ulLowPowerTimeAfterSleep;

    disable_interrupts();

    /* Ensure it is still ok to enter the sleep mode. */
    eSleepStatus = eTaskConfirmSleepModeStatus();

    if( eSleepStatus == eAbortSleep )
    {
        /* A task has been moved out of the Blocked state since this macro was
           executed, or a context siwth is being held pending.  Do not enter a

        prvStartTickInterruptTimer();
        enable_interrupts();
    }
    else
    {
        if( eSleepStatus == eNoTasksWaitingTimeout )
        {
            /* It is not necessary to configure an interrupt to bring the
               microcontroller out of its low power state at a fixed time in 
               the future. */
            prvSleep();
        }
        else
        {
            /* Configure an interrupt to bring the microcontroller out of its low
               power state at the time the kernel next needs to execute.  The
               interrupt must be generated from a source that remains operational
               when the microcontroller is in a low power state. */
            vSetWakeTimeInterrupt( xExpectedIdleTime );

            /* Enter the low power state. */
            prvSleep();

            /* Determine how long the microcontroller was actually in a low power
               state for, which will be less than xExpectedIdleTime if the
               microcontroller was brought out of low power mode by an interrupt
               other than that configured by the vSetWakeTimeInterrupt() call.
               Note that the scheduler is suspended before
               portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP() is called, and resumed when
               portSUPPRESS_TICKS_AND_SLEEP() returns.  Therefore no other tasks will
               execute until this function completes. */
            ulLowPowerTimeAfterSleep = ulGetExternalTime();

            /* Correct the kernels tick count to account for the time the
               microcontroller spent in its low power state. */
            vTaskStepTick( ulLowPowerTimeAfterSleep - ulLowPowerTimeBeforeSleep );
        }

        /* Exit the critical section - it might be possible to do this immediately
           after the prvSleep() calls. */
        enable_interrupts();

        /* Restart the timer that is generating the tick interrupt. */
        prvStartTickInterruptTimer();
    }
}
```

## 11.5 Idle Task Hook Function

The Idle task can optionally call an application defined hook (or callback) function - the idle hook. 
The idle task runs at the lowest priority, so such an idle hook function will only get executed when 
there are no tasks of higher priority that are able to run. This makes the Idle hook function an ideal 
place to put the processor into a low power state - providing an automatic power saving whenever there 
is no processing to be performed. The Idle hook will only get called if `configUSE_IDLE_HOOK` is set 
to 1 within FreeRTOSConfig.h.

<a name="list11.7" title="Listing 11.7 The vApplicationIdleHook API function prototype"></a>

```c
void vApplicationIdleHook( void );
```
***Listing 11.7*** *The vApplicationIdleHook API function prototype*


The idle hook is called repeatedly as long as the idle task is running. It is paramount that the idle 
hook function does not call any API functions that could cause it to block. Also, if the application 
makes use of the `vTaskDelete()` API function then the idle task hook must be allowed to periodically 
return, since the idle task is responsible for cleaning up the resources that were allocated by the RTOS 
kernel to the task that has been deleted.
